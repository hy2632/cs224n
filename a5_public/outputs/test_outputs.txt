You know what I do is I write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can wear you as a farmer, or leather clothes, and never nobody has chosen an farmer.
Today I'm here to talk to you about circles and epiphytes.
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that would fall to you somewhere.
You just have to turn back to the apple to see it as an epiphany.
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bolillian.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the '60s in the middle school, in Stean, Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When they were beaten up to bleed every week in the kids' bathroom, until a teacher saved me life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the teacher's room.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1980s, I felt the need to start working on organizations that fought AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night I received a phone call from that teacher, the lady Post he said,``I need to see you.
I'm disillusioned that we have never got to know us.
You could come to Ohio, and please bring that man who I know you've already found.
And I've got to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to shut up with this please . ''
Okay, the next day we were in Cleveland.
We went to see it, we laugh, we cried, and we realized she needed to be hospital.
We found a place, we found it, and we took care of her family, because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as well as the woman who wanted to know as a grown-up, he became a home box, and he was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you was made present in itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
I need truth and beauty, and I, , I I, I I, I I, I, I, I, I was very happy today.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure . And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first tablets.
I was amazed.
My heart pounding fast, I was shaked, trying to understand what was in front of me.
The sheets of the water around me, almost 60 meters, and I couldn't think that it was a snowflake of snow about another year after year.
The athletes are born when they get rid of glaciers or break the ice barriers.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hang up to the end, while others can't support it anymore and fall into a dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you look at a iceberg, that are isolated and alone, in large measure as we see us sometimes as humans.
But reality is all the opposite.
As it melts a iceberg, I'm breathing its ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts, it releases rich fresh water in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I came up to photograph these iceberg as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not death when they melt; it's not an end, but a continuation of its path for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice's ice is very young -- it's got a couple thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a smartphone that I photographed in Kerongthesis, Greenland.
It's little often to get a rolling iceberg.
Here you have.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the form of the iceberg and your flower line.
You can see here, it starts rolling, the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an average Greenland iceberg.
The water of the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so, the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one of us having a baby . Okay.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to stop too much at the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception itself, you're not going to pay me attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in one case, chromosome and sperm joins the X chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case, the chromosome X chromosome joins the X chromosome of the egg.
Both of them are, and it starts life.
We'll come back to talk about them later.
In my activity, it's going to be two roles.
In one of my roles, I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a historian by training and what I study in this case is the way people embrace anatomy -- to say, of human bodies and animals, how they have considered body fluids, the idea of the body -- what they've thought about about the body.
The other role that I play in my work is activist, as a patient advocate or, as I say sometimes, implementation of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with six twins, two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with economists; people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of anti-propanity people, individuals whose physical psychology doesn't fit in male schemes and conventional feminine.
In general lines, we can call it interactive.
International interactions so many forms.
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't fit in the male or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual with the U.S. communication, which gene SR gene, and it tells the prototypes, that we all have in the fetal life, which becomes testicles.
And then, in the fetal life, testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks of testosterone receptors, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the syndrome of insulin insulin.
So, there are high levels of testosterone, but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops following a completely female course.
When it's born, the baby has a little girl.
It's a girl . It's raised as a girl.
And, often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the senses, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something's going on.
After doing tests, you realize that instead of having ovaries and uterus, it actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like this.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called super-solidarial glands.
They're on the top of the body.
Super-source glands produce anger, the hormone of masculinity.
Most women as I consider a typical woman; it doesn't know their communication structure; I I, I, I I, I is a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the analysis.
We produce anger and respond to the androids.
As a consequence, someone like me has the brain most exposed to the farmers that the woman who was born with testicles that has the syndrome of insulin insulin.
So sex is something complicated . It's not that the innovators are in the middle of the spectrum -- they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I received a call from a 19-year-old girl born and raised as they were going on, had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, carried a life as a boy and just discovered that he had ovaries and uterus.
It had an extreme form of a disease known as a super-solidable hypothetical.
He had 20th chromosomes, and in the uterus, super-source glands were so active that, essentially, they created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were manipulated, their brain was exposed to the fully male hormone component.
I was born with a kind of child; no one suspected.
And it was at the age of 19 when it started to have medical problems caused by internal menstruation, when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of an interaction case.
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what's known as operators, which is, they have an organic tissue wrapped into terrorist tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are lots of sex varieties.
The reason why children with these kinds of bodies are end, size twins, or intellectuals are subjected to normal surgery is not to be able to get better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why they're subjected to various surgeries is that they are a threat for our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy gives you a particular identity.
We have the idea that being women is to have female identity, supposedly, being black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
It's a terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with categorize.
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture about individuality.
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic individuality.
Imagine how surprising it is to have children who are born like two people in the same body.
The most laptop case is last year with the South African Coralon corridor, and it was put on trial of their sex in the Berlin International Games.
A lot of journalists called the question,``What do you test to do to determine whether Casey Week is man or woman? ''
And I had to explain to the journalists that don't exist such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a tangible line between men and women or between men and innovators and researchers, and we are who we are doing that line.
So, what we have is a situation where the more science advances, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were stable anatomic categories that correspond directly with stable industrial categories -- are much more difficult than we thought.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology allows.
As we see, we get into a strategy.
Let's look, for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What are we going to do from the fact that we can tell from them in just a few nucleotides?
And as we progress in science, we get more and more in an awkward zone where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories that we're probably moving are too simplistic.
And we're looking at this in all the habitats of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to look at a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the fetus.
There are very classific discussions today, but it's not in public, but I know within the medicine, when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to look at them with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him, they'd put a feather in front of the nose, and if it moved you still didn't understand it.
If I stopped moving, they did it.
But today we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a consequence, we need to confront the dilemma of determining somebody's death really, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be able to joy someone like me.
In politics, I'm progressive, defending people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it puts me nervous.
Realizing that these categories are much more unstable than we thought I was tense.
It's Tennessee from the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension, I I have to admit that I'm an admired fervent from the founding parents.
I know they were racist, I know they were sexist, but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find each so much looking at that music,``1777"and not for music, which is totally likely.
That's why it happened in 1777 with the founding parents.
The founding parents were, for me, the first anti-police activists and explains why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And, as everybody remembers, what our founding parents rejected was the idea of monarchy, the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of the anatomy.
The old world monarchs don't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it came to the political power for the training of the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The founding parents rejected that idea and replaced it by a new anatomic concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They lived the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy, and not the anatomic differences . That was really radical.
And in part, they were doing it because they were part of an informed system in which they were getting two things.
The democracy was going on, and at the same time, science was born.
And it's very clear, if we look at the history of the founding parents, that many were very interested in science and the idea of a natural world.
They were being distracted from the supernatural explanations, and therefore they rejected the concept of supernatural power, transmitted by a kind of empty idea of birth.
They were moving towards a natural concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence, they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence, we were broadcasting the idea of anatomic coincidence.
And by doing that, they were sitting in the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happens years later?
And women succeeded.
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the South Trek street, who said,``Am I not a woman? ''
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights Movement saying,``I'm a man . ''
Again, color people who appealed to the anatomical coincidence about anatomical difference, and again, they succeeded.
We see the same thing with the disability movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the coincidence, we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain divisions.
But, attention, I want to keep some anatomic divisions in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say we should give up the anatomy.
I don't want to say that five year-old children were allowed to have sexual relationships or marry.
There are some anatomic divisions that make sense, and I think we should keep.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them, and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two ones that we've been focused on at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both of us who are in the middle of 1979, exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1 , 1980.
Henry, in the opposite, was born in terms: one of March 1 , 1980.
For the only fact that we've been born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all of that not because he has a different biological age, but because he was born after.
We find other areas relative to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered man, as well, I haven't told you whether it's D.C., in virtue of being considered man now, it's possible from the mandatory roller that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on its part, doesn't have the same rights to the marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So they still persist anatomic categories that in several ways are problematic and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science advances so much in the field of the anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be wet?
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time, I feel like science is wrong.
Where do we go?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude, ,``Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do it . ''
But many people are trapped in a rare position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man, you don't have to have a chromosome, and that to marry a woman, you have to have chromosome.
Now, in practice, they don't make any common exams to people.
But this is also very strange, given the story that I told you at the beginning of the syndrome of insulin insulin.
If you look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech,``I was giving me a solution . ''
It says that we should judge people, not the color of their skin, but in the content of their character ,"going beyond the anatomy.
And I mean,``Yes, the idea looks very good . ''
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on your character?
I want to point out, too, that I'm not sure that we should be based on this to give people rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some of the things that probably deserve the social services that some humans I know.
I also want to say that perhaps some words I know can make more, smart, intelligent decisions on their sexual relationships that people in 40 who I know.
So how do you practice the subject of character content?
It's very difficult.
And a part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, perhaps with a magnetic resonance.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important than America is going to continue to guide this stream of thinking relative to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we'll do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted by other men is susceptible to being killed, unless he's willing to deliver a sex change, in which case he's allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked to a couple of years ago that I had made a little baby twins, and then to separate them, and so on.
But when on the phone, I asked the reason for the operation, it was a very risky operation, I was told that in that other country, these kids would be very battered, and so I had to do it.
And I said,``Well, have you considered the political asylum instead of the surgical separation? ''
America offers enormous possibilities to people to be who they are without forcing them to change for the state of the state.
So I think we need to be in your head.
Well, to finish I mean I've been talking a lot about the parents.
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to mothers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and it's that I think there can be different ideas coming from different anatomic psychology, particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years, since I've been interested in interaction, I've also been interested in investigating sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about traditional studies is that women, on average, not all, but on average tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to occupy those who are vulnerable within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in the graduate, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminist -- I was considered feminist, as I did a strange plan.
\" Tell me what the feminist is about . ''
And I thought,``It's the most silly question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with getting rid of gender stereotypes, so there's nothing female in feminism . ''
But the more I've thought about the question, the more it has been a female thing in feminism.
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attention to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So, while parents were very helpful to find a way to protect people from the state, it is possible that, to have injected more mothers to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with a reciprocal support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we take democracy beyond the anatomy: thinking less about the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect union, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go to live and work, it has the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't count with a single city willing to get them.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their construction cost.
So we could easily give it to the world tens, maybe hundreds, new cities.
Well, this can sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just replace them by apartment buildings.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments are already owned, and that the other half would still be missing to do it.
They could try to increase the ability by making expanding in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem you'll face is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the annoying and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all of those expansion.
But they could go to a completely new place, build a whole new apartment building building, always, and when the norms of that place facilitate construction instead of putting them together.
So I proposed that governments create new enough areas of great enough to contain cities, and I gave them a name: cities under status.
Later I learned that more or less at the same time, Japan and October were thinking about the challenge of Housian reform.
They knew that every year about 75,000 hours came out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 in the summer of the Horse 2009, he was a desperate constitution.
In the next regular elections, Jesse Labs is promised with a platform in which I promises reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked Ocean to be his head.
And meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of perfection, trial and error and a lot of testing with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under status to their most essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and bother all the current residents of apartments.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies and rules to progress, and usually it's the norms that prevent us to move forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him a link with the TEDTalk.
I showed it to Japan.
They called me.
They said,``Let's present this to the leaders of our country . ''
So in December we met in Miami, in a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their monetary cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York . Look at them -- land that, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, October said,``Paul, maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk talk . ''
And the talk described in very simple terms that a low status city is a place where you start with the laptops, a status that specifies the rules that will be applied there and a choice so that people can choose whether they want to go or not to live under those norms.
So the president of Honduras called me, and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
I was asked to go to Texture and talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, that I was trying to explain that to generate a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of Denver, and the white line is the new airport that was built in Denver.
Only this airport covers over 100 square kilometers.
So I was trying to convince the slingers that to build a new city, you have to start with a site which is at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody applauded in the world.
The public faces were very serious and attentive.
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said,``Professor Rome, thank you very much for your talk, but maybe you could see the video of the TEDTalk talk.
I have it here in my computer . ''
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explains the essential thing -- that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you might be able to be in Honduras, rather than hundreds of miles away to North.
And it will also include new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the Honduras government would need help of associated countries, they could benefit from the associated countries that would help them to establish and make the standards of the status, so that everybody could trust that the status is effectively turned.
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could take a thousand square kilometers.
And shortly after, January 19, they voted in Congress to get their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these special development regions.
In a country that just passed through this painful crisis, voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one.
All the parties, all the factions in society, the backs.
To include the Constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
The 17th of February passed again in another voting, from 115 to one.
Immediately after voting , 21 to 24 of February, a delegation of about 30 units went to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that's being built in South Korea; it's bigger than Boston's center.
Everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting permission.
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about it in a practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow administrators to come, and at the same time allowed to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already been committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the state-of-the-art court for this new court system.
There are urban users and cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that want to install the Americas, especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to immediately change another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go to work; sometimes they're single mothers who have to earn money for just eating or buying clothes.
Sadly, sometimes even kids are trying to meet their parents that they haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about the construction of a new city in Honduras?
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to them to think about, so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new residents?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my fellow friends asked me to say,``Thank you TED . ''
I'm Jesse, and this is my courage.
But before I showed you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession, and that is, I live obsessed with suits.
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog, suit, colorful and different for each occasion.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of pollution and a second hand.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my guide in the environment and my wallet.
I get to know interesting people; usually my money goes to a good cause; I look unique; and buy becomes my personal test of treasures.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it from my shop?
I'd like the color?
Is it less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
And back to my value's theme, I want to tell you what I did for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring up with somebody who has all that clothes?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
In the inner clothes for a week, it's all I've put in my value.
I imagine it would be able to find everything else I wanted to use after I got here to Palm Springs.
And because I don't know me as the woman walking through TED in inner underwear, that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
Doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that I believe, or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
The whole set, including the jacket, was 55, and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
Monday: color is energy.
It's almost physically impossible to be a bad mood, when you're seeing a brilliant red screen.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
Mars: integration is supported.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time to integrate.
I just know yourself.
If you're surrounded by the right people, you're not just going to understand you, you will also learn.
Wednesday: The child you carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play discoveries, or I remind them to their age of seven.
I like to smile and say,``Thank you . ''
Thursday: trust is the key.
If you think you look good with something, it's almost sure you're.
And if you think you don't look good with something, you probably also be true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the age of 30 who really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, there's no look that you can't catch.
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
Friday: A universal truth, six words for you: The golden lentils go with everything.
And finally, Saturday: develop a personal, unique way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tried it over and over again when people came up to me this week just by what I was using . And we had fantastic conversations.
This is obviously not going to go into my little value.
So before I go home, Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave some things.
I don't need to get emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy, colorful, brilliant suit, if there's a little love in my heart and looking.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So, if we use a scale to measure the attitude of every hemisphere, we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So where would you take your brain on this scale?
Some of them would opt for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the incentives of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great attitude in both hemispheres at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider one of those people that just like most of the other experimental quantum physicists, we need quite a lot of logic to match these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well, we like to play with things.
We're going to play with them, and then we see how they react, and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
Now, certain intuition that you can have developed with the years's step is the one that says one thing can be only one place at a time.
That is, it can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
He was a little kid, and he didn't do it very well, he always fell.
But I bet that playing with that parking bar is taught a valuable lesson, and it's that big things don't allow them to pass them, and they remain in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physics.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they find out that they do all kinds of really weird things -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it quantum mechanics theory.
And at that point, a few years ago, a few years ago, you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not much.
And I've never seen them.
That is, never nobody saw a particle.
But it didn't fit to my logical part.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then shouldn't everything follow quantum mechanics principles?
I don't find the reason why I shouldn't.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in a quantum mechanics superpower.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal fish that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to expand a little bit . It's right in the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the little metal trick.
What we see is a little little bit of metal, with transportation, and it's supported in a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I went to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this one-two-three-four hole that's under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superpower, but for it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up, I stop doing those things, because I don't want to bother them, or actually scare.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The travel partners of inanimate objects are not just people, and it's also the light that's crushed and the wind that goes on on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to exploit all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We turn out the lights, then we introduced a vacuum and we extracted all the air, and then we cooled it into a temperature of less than a degree on the absolute zero.
Now, by being on the elevator, the little piece of metal is free to act as it wants.
So we measured their movements.
We found it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly clear, I was vibrating . And the way I was vibrating was like a breath in this form -- as a shape that expands and contracts.
And by giving it a smooth push, we could make it vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing vibrating and doesn't vibrate at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of atoms that make that piece of metal are still, and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain times when those are aligned.
In the rest of time they're delivered.
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what once means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was worth going to be in a clean room to do this for all those years, because look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that metal piece and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you too?
I mean, it's my logical part I talk about.
So if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was delivered in space?
There's another part of history.
And it's when we heat it, and we turn the lights up and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects in the elevator, actually only quantum objects that are just made in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep rarity of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is American.
And 18 months ago, I did another work in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss, which is here and allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months.
Lots of negotiations and stories, I assure it, with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the demo.
There's a lot of stories about why we did it.
I think my own story is simply explained in this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
A big education -- I didn't complain about it, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork works.
So when I started traveling and going to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
It's better than it shows the demo to then explain a couple of interesting things that we've been doing from its launch.
So simply, we go to Georgetown.
Look around all the museums that there is.
There's the Ugage gallery, MoMA, Emma, Rupid, Van Gogh.
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, to the Metropolitan, the art museum in New York.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and, oh, we're inside the museum.
No matter where you are, Bombay or Mexico, that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you get fun.
Do you want to navigate the museum?
We open the plane up, and with one click, we jump inside.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall.
Keep forward . Get fun!
Explore.
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings,``The Corporations"of Pieter Breilling at the Metropolitan.
I see the sign.
If the museum shows you the picture, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all of the data of metadata.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the giant technology.
So this picture, for example, contains, I I, about 10,000 billion pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask me,``And what do you get with 10 billion pixels? ''
So I'll show you what you really get with 10 billion pixels.
It can make me a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really wish to deep.
So I started playing, and I found something that happened there.
And I said,``A moment, this looks interesting . ''
I went into and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the Metropolitan, and I actually discovered that this is a game called [unclear] ], which is to hit an ocean with a stick on the Tuesday Tuesday.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did it, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper in depth and see that you can actually get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to leave the picture, so you'll see really what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we'll quickly jump to MoMA again in New York City.
Here's another one of my favorites,``The Night Star . ''
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the paintbrush?
And if you want to see how they're going,``How do you actually create this masterpiece? ''
I increase it and really do it.
I go to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is``The Night Star ,"I I think I've never seen it like that before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part . It's called``collections . ''
All of you, absolutely everybody, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a mansion, that gives the same.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we go in, -- I've created this function I call``The Power of the Roman ,"-- we just made a jet around.
This is``The Buddhists"in the National Gallery of London.
You can notice things, send it to your friends and maintain a conversation about what you feel by contemplating these masterpieces.
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all incredible things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even they don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium, you do justice to your artwork and it's represented properly online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is,``Did you do this to repeat the experience of going to a museum? ''
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's all . Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a pixel, a flying pixel.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I I, I I, I I, all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of your bedroom, but the reason I show you this is that something very interesting has happened in Formula 1 careers in the last two decades.
Now, a few time ago, if you wanted to win a Francis 1 career, I would take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what, in engineering, is called a real time control system.
In essence, it's a system that has two components: a sensor and an accident.
What's interesting today is that the real-time control systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered from networks and electronics.
They're becoming computers in the air.
And, as such, they're starting to respond differently and they can be detected and accidents.
Coming out of cities is a big thing.
As a note, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of energy consumption -- and up to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these detectors and activities are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition from Paul Angle for late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called``Tox . ''
Well, our objects, the environment, start to talk to us.
In a way, it's like almost all existing atoms would become sensors and actuators.
And that's changing the interaction that we as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old Michelangelo dream.
You know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses, he says that at the end, he took the hammer and he brought it to the Moses, and he still can see a little melody underneath and he said screaming,``Hey, don't you talk? ''
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to talk to us.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples, and I'm going to show you in the idea of capturing the environment and acting something.
Let's start with detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in the late 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup.
Maybe some of them remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the Zidster, he gave the head.
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day watching activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the Coliseum in the middle and the Earth.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
For the early evening there are people here and there, making calls, moving.
It starts the Party: silence.
Grandma from France . Google from Italy.
Entrepreneur; people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time . End of the regular time.
First extra time, second.
King, and at a moment, the head.
Gan Italy, yeah!
That night, everybody went to celebrate the center.
You see the big peak.
The next day they were all the center of the winning team and the first minister of then.
And then everybody goes down.
You see the picture of the place called Circle Massachuse where, from the Roman time, people are going to celebrate; it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of detection: not about people, but about things that we use and consume.
Today we know everything about the production of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac, how they assemble.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle just over a year ago, to label what they were throwing -- different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all ways would throw.
Then we put a little chip, a tag, to the trash, and then we started tracking it.
These are the results.
From Seattle.
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are a lot of inefficiencies in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
It's happening complicated stuff, and there's a interesting transportation.
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we're running on, it's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we shine one day still is there.
That if we show people that, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason from the project.
My colleague of MIT, Assanaight Birdin, could tell you a lot more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we mentioned at the beginning, which is to act on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Karachi.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, will join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was: imagine that they have a camel and valves, solar valves, lengths that open and close.
It's created like a water curtain, with water pixels.
If you fall the pixels, you can write in them, to show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so we can pass, as you see in the image.
We presented this to Mayor Bellow.
She liked a lot.
And it uses a commission to design the building to the expo.
We call it the Digital Water pavilion.
The whole building is made of water.
There are no doors or windows, but when you approach you open up so you can pass.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little wind, if you want to minimize the sales, you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said,``Get the building . ''
No, it's not that they have demolished it, but when it comes down almost all architecture, it disappears.
Here's a functioning.
You see the people who are intrigued by what happens inside.
And here I am trying to not get wet by testing the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened a night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children in Zander came into the building because the way of interacting had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open up, but a building that kept making cuts and water holes and you had to jump to not get wet.
( People noise) And for us, that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels, water pixels, and projections about them.
And this is what led us to thinking about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, moving with other ones in sync.
We could form this cloud.
A kind of flexible screen like this with normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen would appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can zoom in, and go through, and see from very different angles.
This is the real controlled Florida, going down to a V, like before.
When the light goes on, it looks like this . The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have every pixel with an entrance that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with Robert Boll, one of the best ballet dancers of today, the New York City Metal and Millennium School to capture its 3D movements and use them as an entry for the Florida.
Here we can see Robert dancing.
On the left you see the pixels, the capture in different resolutions.
It's so much 3D digitization in real time as a movement capture.
It can rebuild all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and rotation.
We want to use this as a possible entry for the Florida.
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the cloud.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment, almost like a cloud of clouds like the grain soup, but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make everyone donated a little bit for a pixel.
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened over the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spend the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- the Obama campaign, we can go through the digital world, the self-organizing power of networks, the physical world.
In our case, this might want to use it to design and make a symbol.
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people engage in doing this together, collectively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, while in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but the pixel covers.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital forum at night, but most importantly, it's going to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than you are?
Suppose I told you that, with just some changes in their genes, they could improve memory -- for a more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, to be stronger, to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure from themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe it's those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What would you most like?
What would you like, if you could choose something?
( Audience member: Creativity .) Creativity.
How many people choose creativity?
Raise your hand . Let me see.
A few . It was probably the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many will memory choose?
A few more.
What about the physical state?
A little less.
How about longevity?
Oh, most of it . That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this, the world would be very different.
Is it just imagination?
Or maybe possible?
Evolution has been a personal theme here at the TED Conference, but today I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The great 20th century genocide, Twitter, Jewstream, who also ran in the Ortail Church Russian, wrote an essay called``Nothing in biology makes sense except to the light of evolution . ''
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: is it just about the past, or the future?
Does it mean others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at an end, is, of course, the most of us.
We have a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the interval there has been maybe 20 different species of hominids.
Some have gone back and forth.
We've been here about 130 years.
And it might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
Do you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that's used to treat diabetes?
This is not like human insulin, but it's the same protein, chemically inevitable, that it comes out of the pancreas.
And talking about bacteria -- do you realize we all carry in the most bacteria that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times.
I mean, think about -- when Antarctica American raises you from the self-confidence -- you think about bacteria?
The gut is a wonderfully hospital environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark, wet, is very close.
And we're going to provide all of the nutrients that you can want without effort of your part.
It's really like a quick road for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some light bulb to the output.
But, by the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our lives.
They help us digest essential nutrients, and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what would the future stop us?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or do you want to become a different thing, maybe better adapted to the environment?
In this vast unconscious symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief company -- the animal kingdom, as one and only unique companies, and human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the entertaining part of this talk, so I hope you've enjoyed it.
When I recently entered college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental: in most of the existence of life, in the single-celled organisms, every cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when multicellular organisms appear, things start to change.
It enters sexual reproduction.
And something very important: with the emergence of sexual reproduction that's happening, the rest of the body becomes presentative.
In fact, you could say that the inevitability of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student, I thought, well, sexual, sexual death, for sex, it seemed quite reasonable at the time, but with every year that happened, it had more and more doubt.
I came to understand the feelings of George Burns, who still act in Las Vegas, entered in its 90s.
And one night, somebody hit their hotel door.
He opens the door.
And in front of him, you find a magnificent light sheet.
He looks at it and says,``I come in search of a``sex soup . ''
\" Okay ,"George says,``I chose the soup . ''
I realized, as a doctor, I was working for a different goal to the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to stay healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and healthier.
Evolution is to spend the genome to the next generation, adapting and surviving generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like reference rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next orbital level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all understand the feeling that Woody Allen said when he said,``I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to do it not dying . ''
Evolution doesn't necessarily favor longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favor the bigger or the strongest or the faster or even the smartest.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only trial and success test.
At the bottom of the ocean, the temporal bacteria that can survive the heat of the smokers that will produce, if there were fish there, fish cooked in the vacuum, yet, have made that a a appropriate environment.
So what does this mean, when we look at what's happening in evolution, and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward, the next phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't evolve.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've been able to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been discarded and removed from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've focused our environment to adapt to us as well as we adapt to him.
And by the way, we migrate, we circulate, and we're so excited about so much that it's not possible to have the isolation necessary for evolution to happen.
A second possibility is that you produce an evolution of traditional, natural type, tax by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution roll down, but they're interferenced.
And in the isolation, when as a species we're using distant planets, there are going to be isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an attractive, intriguing, scary possibility.
I call it the new evolution, the new evolution, which is not just natural -- but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the decisions we will take.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose at individual and family level.
Think also that if you could be able to choose not only the sex of your offspring, it's in your own body to make the genetic adjust to cure or prevent disease.
What if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce cancer risk or eliminate the app?
Wouldn't they want to make those changes in their genes?
If we look at the future, that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and it took 13 years.
It cost 2.7 billion dollars.
The next year of having finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a close cost to 20,000 dollars and in a week.
It's not going to take a lot for the human genome to make the human genome for $1,000 and getting closer and closer to all.
These changes are coming.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that not only will protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce other viruses.
Believe or there's no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against growing flu in cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good from tobacco?
That's reality today and in the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just other two little changes.
Can you change your bodies, but if you could change your offspring cells?
What if they could change the sperm and the eggs, or change the only fertilized egg, and give their kids a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating the hospitality, reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want healthier children?
And then, that same analytical technology, that same motor of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to also adopt hypotheses -- a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken Jennings, especially if you could increase it with the next generation of the Watson machine?
Why don't you have a tracking muscle that allows us to run faster and more distance?
Why not live longer?
This is going to be irrigatory.
And when we're in conditions of going through this to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes that we want to have become the evolution of before the winter.
We're going to take a process that could normally take 100,000 years, and we can compress it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
Are we going to use these options in a better society, more successful, more considered?
Or are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for others?
Are we going to build a society that's more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile?
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound about everything: are we going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these decisions wisely?
For good or bad, and before what I could think, these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor clicking, click, click.
clicks, click, click, click . Sounds frightening.
Well, I had a unique seat that day . I was sitting in the 12th.
It was the only one who could talk to flight assistants.
So immediately I looked at them, and they said,``No problem . We probably hit some birds . ''
The pilot had already lived the plane, and we weren't so far away.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot rings the plane with the Hudson River.
It's usually not the route.
He took up the engines.
Imagine being on a plane and without noise.
And then he said three words.
The three most depressing words I've heard.
He said,``Press for the impact . ''
I didn't have to talk more with flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror . Life was finished.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get, and I didn't, all the fences I wanted to repair, all the experiences I've wanted to have and never had.
As I thought about that later, I came a phrase, which is,``I collect bad wine . ''
Because if the wine is ready, and the person is there, I'm going to open it up.
I don't want to clap anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is while we were avoiding the George Washington Bridge, which wasn't very much -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a big weight.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also give birth to my ego.
And I'm sorry the time that I wasted on things that didn't matter with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as I measured in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels wonder.
I'm no longer trying to be right; it chose to be happy.
The third thing that I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going down,``15 , 14 , 13 . ''
You see the water to approximate.
I'm saying,``Please fly . ''
I don't want this to break in 20 pieces as you see in those documents.
And as we went down, I had the feeling of, wow, it's not scary.
It's almost like we've been preparing for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go; I love my life.
And that sadness came into a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids growing.
A month later, I was in an act of my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic talent -- still . And screaming, crying, as a little.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point I understood, by connecting those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
Especially, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I get a miracle, not to die that day.
And I got another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and back and living in another way.
You who are flying today, the challenges to imagine that the same thing happens in their airplane -- and please don't -- but imagine, and how would you change?
What do you do, you still expect to do because you think you're going to live forever?
How would they change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, are the best parents you can?
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many amazing projects.
But the most great thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy's called TEDx.
TMM was one of the most important graffiti in the '80s.
One day he came home after running and said,``Dad, I feel an ant in the legs . ''
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Now, TEDx has a total paralysis.
It can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and respect in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony, TEDMED, and his cause.
So I went and met with her brother and father and said,``Let's give you this money.
What are you going to do with it? ''
And his brother said,``I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me . ''
And I said,``One second, isn't that I've seen Stephen Hawking is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those devices? ''
And he said,``No, unless you're somebody important and you have a very good insurance, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people . ''
And I said,``Well, how do you communicate then? ''
Does anyone see the movie``The Scale and the butterfly? ''
They communicate that way -- they're marching with the finger.
I said,``That's archaic . How can it be? ''
So I was presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead I signed a check that didn't have the least idea of how it was going to cover.
I got engaged with her brother, and with her father there at that time,``All right, this is the deal: Tony's going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in their inside can't communicate . ''
So I spoke in a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called Grammer Research Lab, who have a technology that allows them to project a light in any surface, and then, with a laser pointer, draw about that and record the negative space.
So they go around doing art installation like this.
All the things that appear, they say, are part of a cycle of life.
First start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and at the end, people start making art.
But there was always a cycle of life in his presentations.
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move things on one side to another, we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of insurance companies and we got a machine so that temperature could communicate -- a machine like Stephen Hawking.
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most fun thing; I call it the Youtube, because when you talk to the guy, you get an email from him, and you say,``I don't deserve it . This guy is fantastic . ''
The other thing we did was brought seven programmers around the world literally all the corners of the planet to our house.
My wife, kids and I, moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and constraints and contradictions took the control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid, and when we turned back would have taken off the squares of the walls and instead there would be graffiti.
But for two weeks we were programming, we went to the sea floor of Venice, my son was part, my dog also, and we created this.
It's called Exhibition, and you can see the description.
It's a couple of cheap sunglasses that we bought on the sea floor of Venice Beach, some copper wire, and Home Department and Radio Shakespeare.
We take a PRISM camera, we open it, we put it on a LED light, and now there's a device that's free -- you build yourself; we published the free code, the software is low.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company that says``no . ''
There's no hospital that can say``no . ''
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much to you . That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the TEDMED room.
I love this picture because this is the other person's room, and that's his room.
There was all this bullet and an article during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming, intense sessions overnight, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and you're looking through the support system of your life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking parking wall.
And he came back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and they would imagine what was the feeling in parking.
The funny thing was that we had to break into the parking, so we felt like we were reading graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email, and this was what he said,``This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I'd been under the water, and somebody finally came to rescue me and I would get out of there so I could breathe . ''
Isn't it wonderful?
In some ways that's our scream of war.
That's what keeps us in motion, developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of a Magic screen.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and faster.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's free; none of us is making money with this.
It all comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the guy,``Oh, this is fantastic . ''
Armstrong tweeted something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about this -- and this is what I end up closing the circle is that in April of this year at the Mother Chef in the center of Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called``Art in the streets . ''
And``Art in the streets"is going to have the best experts of urban U.N., Shakespeare Faire, CDs, all of them will be there.
TEDx is going to be in the show which is quite impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: If you see something that's not possible, let it possibly.
None of the things in this room was possible -- stage, computer, microphone, Redwood nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it possible -- anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I I never did anything with eye recognition technology; I just recognized something and associated with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we sit on to do . If it's not now, when isn't I, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years to move into very difficult situations and at the same time a so dangerous.
I went to jail -- hard.
I worked on a coal mine -- dangerous.
I filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this -- fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been immersed in strange situations with the only goal of trying to try and examine social issues in ways that are attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyze them in a way that they were trained and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands, and the patient wanted to do something a little different.
So some may have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago in eBay.
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights from my TEDTalk.
What was the next thing:``AM Southern Now Present: My TEDTalk of which you have no idea what it's about and as content could exploit it in your face, especially if I put it in ridicule to you or your company by doing it.
But said this, it's a very good media opportunity . ''
Do you know how many people look at these TEDTalks?
A lot.
It's an issue in progress, by the way.
So I still knew that somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If I had asked you a year ago, I couldn't have been able to tell you with certainty.
But in the new film I'm working on, we examine the world of marketing, of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could be anticipate, for something so hard or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan Spanish: I I, I I I, I I, I want to make a film that deals with product collection, marketing and advertising, and that all of the film is funded with products of products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call the largest movie ever sold.
What happens in``The largest ever sold"is that everything from the top down, from beginning to end, has brand images, all the time -- from the presence that appears before the title, the X mark.
Now this brand, Wormis Stanford, the Star Center.
These people are going to be associated with the film to perfect -- forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea . (Michael Kassan: It's reduced .) It's what? (MK: Is it redundant .) Is it a perfect?
I'm a redundant cheese . (MK: I just say it.
It was``A Perfect . Always . ''
But we're not just going to have the X brand sponsor in the title, but we're going to make sure that we can make sure all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe we'll sell a shoe, and it becomes the most great shoe you've used ...
The most great car you've been driving in``The largest never sold ,"the best piece that you drink, cut out of``The largest ever sold . ''
David Koslin:``The idea is then about showing brands as part of life, making them finance?) MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole idea, all the film, from beginning to end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert Friedman: You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the maximum respect for the audience.
BJ: However, I don't know how it's going to be the people to that.
ZK: You have a perspective -- I don't know if``angle"is very negative, but you know how it's going to be depressed? (MS: No idea .) David Cohen: How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half . (DC: All right .) John Kamen: I think it's going to be hard to meet with them, but that certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands.
ZK: Who knows, perhaps for the moment that the film comes out, we see a lot of random idiots.
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart Rural: Most answers will be``not . ''
MS: But will it be hard to sell, for film or for being me?
JK: Both things.
MS: -- it means you're not very optimistic.
So, do you help me? I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right . (MK: Good .) Amazing.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah . (MK: That's the challenge -- when you look at the people you have to treat ...
MK: We have some places where it's going . (MS: Okay .) Hold up the camera.
MS: I thought,``Leave the camera"meant, we have a conversation outside of microphone.
The camera means,``We don't want to know anything about your film . ''
MS: And so, one for one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of you wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I'm surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very impressed; I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people would see it as possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media, and the scenario of separate media, isn't the idea to tell with that new amount of attention worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the masses?
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a dark error and that mistake was this.
No, no such error.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been good.
But the problem was what this image represents.
See, when you look for transportation images' Google, it appears -- this is one of the first images that appear.
I like your knee way, Sergey Brin . No.
This was the problem: transparency -- free of simulation or deception -- easily detected or seen, easily understandable, that it's characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in business practices -- being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians, the name, the name, even the CEOs are named.
But suddenly when it comes to making it really changes.
But why? Well, transparency gives fear -- like that weird bear that still continues.
It's unpredictable -- like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it risky?
I'll get an entire bowl from Cool White.
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling us we wanted to tell this story, and they said,``No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but you tell our story . ''
See, when I was a kid, and my father caught me in some lie, and there he is looking at me as he used to say,``Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the real story . ''
As you see, in this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanted to help me -- and that's just because I knew John Bond and Richard Syrian in many years I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take the proxy and go to companies myself with my whole team.
So what I started to warn suddenly -- I started to realize that when you start to communicate with companies, the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge films, giant, others who make small, independent films, like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood movies, giant, they say that the reason their films are so successful is due to the associated brands they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say,``Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood movies? ''
And the movie is called``The largest Never sold . ''
How are we going to see specifically Ben in the movie?
Every time I'm going out, every time I open my boat, you'll see the desperate Ben.
At any point during an interview with somebody I can say,``Are you fine for this interview?
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you shut up.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview . ''
And there you would offer one of these fabulous anomalies.
So much``Flag Flag"as``Venter winds"are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a woman, solid, ballet, in bars, like it.
That's the general view.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a proportional view.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
It's similar to the smaller kind of films you told; we're more a rival brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, reminding people, is the reason why this is interesting.
MS: What words would you use to describe Ben?
Ben's in white.
KB: That's a big question.
Woman: top technology.
MS: Technology isn't the way you want to describe something that you're putting in the armpits.
Man: We talk about something audacious, fresh.
I think``cool"is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus``smell of smell and sweat . ''
It keeps you fresh.
How do you keep you fresh longer? With better fresh, more fresh, three times cooler.
Things like those who get the benefits.
MS: And that's a billionaire company.
What about me? What about a common guy?
I need to talk to the man of the street, people like me, to the ordinary Pepses.
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your brand?
Man: Mmm my brand?
I don't know.
I like the good clothes.
Woman: revive the 1980s, payment, unless it's a laundry day.
MS: Okay, what is the Gordon brand?
Gerard: Something unique . (MS: One .) Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a dark glamour.
I like the dark colors too much, so many gray and things like this.
Usually I take accessories like sunglasses, or I like crystals and similar.
Woman: If Dan was a brand, it could be a classic, Mercas Benz.
Man 2: The brand I am, I call it casual flight.
Woman 2: In part hippie, in part yogurt, in part of the Bronx, I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
I sold toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx, because I get the market.
Man 5: Mark friends failure.
Is that something?
lawyer: I I I I I I I . I I . I I.
Tom: I'm Tom.
MS: Well, not all of us can be brand brand, but I often rank on the intersection of dark glamour and flight.
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could enter my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the``brand personality . ''
And I found a company called Oliver Zaulian in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like Neil, February, Hallmark to discover that brand personality.
If they could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
Audience: Traveler photos, right?
MS: Yeah . The first picture is a family photo.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people model my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world where you live -- as people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things originated and start in a place, and in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: what's the next one that you want to talk about?
MS: Next is``This was the best day of my life . ''
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way of being?
MS: It's like who wanted to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things . I like weird things.
A:``Why"-- what does that feel like?
What's the mouse? What is the mouse? How do you find you now?
Why is it important to reset? What does the red represent?
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which isn't who you are.
What other mechanisms have you had?
It doesn't have to be fear . What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: Oh, thank you . No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience . (MS: Great job) A: Yeah . (MS: Thank you very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all of this.
Linda Zuckerman: The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides, but complexity, in your brand personality; the Morgan Spanish brand is a conscious brand.
They are very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only focus on one of their strong points or in the other rather than focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's human nature to avoid things that are not safe; they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give them hip and make it something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are that?
The first here is the classic, Apple.
And you can also see Target here, Wii, Mini Cooper and Jeopardy.
Now there are playful marks and conscious brands, those things that have gone and come, but a Congolin brand is quite powerful.
MS: A Connectic brand . What is your brand?
If somebody asks you to describe your identity identity, your brand personality, what would be?
Are you a advanced attribute? Are you somebody who makes blood flow?
Or are you rather a descending attribute?
A little bit more calm, reserved, conservative?
Adoption attributes are like being playful to be a cold being like the Prince, contemporary, adventure, advantage or audacious like error Florida, fast or agile, profane, dominant, magical or mystic like Gandhi.
Or are you more depressing attributes?
Are you conscious, sophisticated like 2007?
Are you established, traditional, provider, protective ,? Are you identified with Oprah?
Are you reliable, stable, familiar, reliable, safe, sacred, contemporary or wise, like the Dalai Lama or YouTube?
In the course of this film, we had more than 500 companies, advice and offspring, who said``no ,"they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control on the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the neurogenesis, and we came to tell the story in this movie of how MRI now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing and for cinema.
We went to San Paulo where they've banned advertising air advertising.
In the entire city over the last five years, there are no valleys, there are no flaps, there are no flying, nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are doing way in schools with liquidity problems in America.
The incredible thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the biggest answer or the ones that I've had more successful are those where I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands did.
They took the intermediary, they took their agencies, and they said perhaps these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to make people think, that's going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how have you gone? Did you succeed?
Well, , since the movie is stressed in the Sundance Festival, let's take a look.
According to Burkelling, the movie is broken in January, and since then -- -- and this is not all of we have had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two and a half weeks.
That's only online -- no press, no TV.
The movie is still not distributed.
It's still not online . It's not in stability.
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win.
And it's not wrong, because almost all the agencies that we talk about, they were advised to their clients not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get people out of that, you're pushing them into failure.
I think when you train your employees in the risk of the risk, you're preparing your entire company to go from rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to risk.
We have to encourage people to not fear of the opportunities that they can scare them.
Ultimately, to move forward, I think we have to bring place to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
We open the fear . We open the risk.
From a cockroach at once, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to fight transparency.
Today, today that a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk,``We opened the Transparency"has been presented by my good friends of EML who was buying the rights of the name in eBay.
EM: becoming great data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
economics shows``We opened the Transparency . ''
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, Morgan, in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with that $77?
MS: It's an exceptional question.
In my pocket, I have a name of the name of the TED matrix of TED, the Salaam Foundation, a check for $77 to be applied to my TED support of the next year.
The idea behind the Scup computer is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the uranium plant in Natasha.
The gray boxes you see are real-time control systems.
If we managed to engage these systems that control speed and valves, we can cause a lots of problems with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use Windows software; they are a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective Windows virus in a portable computer, used by an engineer to confirm this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind Stuxnet.
We started with a Windows installed.
The eye goes into the gray box, it damage the centrifuge, and the nuclear program, the Iranian nuclear program.
It's easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching about Stuxnet six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that was known is that it's very, very complex in the parts of Windows: the install used multiple dark vulnerability.
It seemed like wanting to do something with these gray boxes, these control systems.
That called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with Stuxnet and we saw what happened with this.
So, very strange things happened.
Stuxnet was behaving as a laboratory rat that he didn't like our cheese: I smelled it, but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And after experimenting with different cheese flavors, I realized, and I thought,``This is a targeted attack.
It's completely directed . ''
The drill is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is effectively working on that place.
If no, Stuxnet does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought,``We don't know what the goal is . ''
It could be, let's say for example, an American energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better we discovered the goal soon.
And so we extracted and we described the attack code, and we discovered that I was structured in two digital bombs: a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were highly armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They know all the dots that I'll attack.
You probably even know how much the operator is.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the Scup installed is complex and high-tech, let me tell you,``payload is very complex . ''
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this attack code.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much at the old assembly language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were called the system function, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for temperatures and data structures and we tried to relate them with the real world, with the targets of the real world.
We need theories about distances that we can approve or disappear.
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely violent savanna, it must be a valuable white, and it's surely located in Iran, because it's where most infection has been reported.
You don't find several thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of the Bush and the Natasha plant.
So I said to my assistant,``Three a list of all the experts in centrifuge and energy plants between our clients . ''
I called them, and I consulted them in an effort for controlling their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital origami with the control of the robot.
The rotate is that mobile part inside the centrifuge, that black object you see.
If you drive the speed of this rotate, you can certainly break it up and even make the centrifuge explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and describe in an obvious effort to get crazy to the nest maintenance engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital eye looking very closely to the data and their structures.
So, for example, the number 64 sounds in that code, you can't be obvious.
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these centrifuge are built in Natasha, and I found that they are structured in what's called a waterfall, and every waterfall contains 64 centrifuge.
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better.
These centers in Iran are divided in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the attack code?
It's almost identical structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had between hands.
And so that there are no misunderstanding: it wasn't.
The results have been obtained after several weeks of hard work.
We were routinely finished in the streets, and we had to go back to start.
Yet, we discovered that both digital birds were going to just one and same goal, but from different angles.
The small eye is taking a waterfall, and making the robots and raising them, and the big glass communicates with six waterfalls and manipulating valves.
In sum, we're very confident that we've determined what the fate is.
It's Natasha, and it's just Natalie.
We shouldn't worry about other goals to be achieved by Stuxnet.
Here I show you a few very interesting things that we saw, really impressed me.
There's the gray box, and up you see the centrifuge.
What this thing is doing is to intercept the input values of sensors for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors, and it provides legitimate code, which still executed during the attack, with false input data.
And believe it or not, this false input data is programmed by Stuxnet.
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the robbery, the security chamber is fed by predictive video.
Is it great?
The idea here is obviously not just going to mock the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and aggressive.
The idea is to pull a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator couldn't act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the great steam turbines goes out of speed, you have to open up escape valves in a millisecond.
Obviously, this cannot do a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're committed, then they can happen bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the operations or the security system will notice it.
That scares.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this . This attack is generic.
It has nothing to do, specifically, with centrifuge, with uranium enclosure.
It could also work, for example, in an energy plant, or in an automated factory.
It's generic.
And you don't have -- as an attacker -- that will disseminate this load with a USB key, as we saw in the case of Stuxnet.
You could also use conventional worms of worms to disseminate it.
Disability it as possible.
And if you did that, with what you end up with is a mass of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we should face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces with great goals.
We need to face the consequences, and better we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Ralph, it has been public in many sides that people assume that the museum is the main entity behind this.
What is your opinion?
Ralph Lank: Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah . Okay.
My opinion is that the museum is involved, but the engine is not Israel.
The engine behind this is cyber superpower.
There's one, and that's the United States, fortunately, fortunately.
Because, otherwise, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for attracting us . Thank you, Ralph.
I want you to imagine a robot that can be taken, and you have sub-Saharan skills, or another one that makes wheelchair users get up and walk back.
In``Berkeley Bionics ,"we call these robots, exoskeletons.
They're nothing different from something that's put in the morning, gives one a big force, who also increases their speed, and helps, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other foreign entities.
This is not a wrong idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier that, on average, has to take on its back a 45 pounds load, and it's getting even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back , 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help us manage the issue.
So let me introduce you to the HOOset -- or``The Universal Human Corporation . ''
Soldier: With the SOEhC exoskeleton, I can cover 90 pounds by variable land for many hours.
It's its flexible design, it allows you to put up and run up and run movements with great agility.
What I want to do, or where I want to go, and then increase my strength and my resistance.
Edith Benjamin: We're ready, with our industrial partner, to produce this device, this new exoskeleton, this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's look back at the users of wheelchair, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in the wheelchair, all over the world.
About one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation.
We talk about something that happens often, very young people, with damage in the motor column, who will start their life -- 20 , 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that goes up quickly.
His only option, many times -- by a brain injury or any other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from its successful appearance, as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to start writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you the LIGO that's using Amanda Boston who was 19 years ago, who had a lesion in the spinal column, and as a result could not walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda Boston: Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our EEG, that I mentioned.
It's got a few sensors.
completely not invasive in the crutches that send signals to the board computer, here in the back.
And also there are some batteries that give energy to the motors in the hip, and in the knees, and they make it move up with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 at the top of my life when, by a strange jump in the air, skiing up the bottom, it was paralyzed.
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all the movements of the pelvis down.
Shortly after, a doctor came into my room in the hospital, and he said,``Amanda, you'll never walk . ''
That's 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last hope of hope of me.
The adaptation technology since then, I've allowed me to learn how to slow down in the ski, scale rocks and even ride in a bike bike.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life to future generations -- not only of soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of wheelchair, all of them.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the battery, sex practice to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And not, it's not the festival of the Indian Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of Congo forests.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest living relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their assault.
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis in this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big, terrifying guys, the Bonobo society is in terms of females with power.
These guys have created something special, because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence hasn't yet observed.
But unfortunately, Bonobos are the least understanding of great apes.
They live in the depths of the Congolese forest, and it's been very difficult to study them.
The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the fog itself -- stage of a violent conflict that has been put for decades and causes almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also put in danger the survival of the Bonobo.
The hunting trade and deforestation is that you can't fill a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the hidden laughter by measuring trees.
Who are these cousins?
We know them as the apes``make love, not war ,"because they have frequent and primater sex to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of humanity's problems because Bonobos's life is more than the Kamma.
Bonobos, like humans, love playing throughout their entire life.
It's not just a game of children.
And for us and for them, the game is fundamental to establish ties and promote tolerance.
With him, we learn to trust, and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with generation generation -- interactions diversity, behavioral diversity, connections diversity.
And when you look at the game game, you see the evolutionary roots themselves, the dance and the human ritual.
The game is the glue that binds us.
I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken out of the wild medium.
First, it's a blood game game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a persecution.
Look at what she's doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase:``You have it from the balls . ''
I just think that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yes.
So the sexual game is common as much in Bonobos and humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play like the testicles, and also how the game requires trust and promotes trust -- and at the same time it's the most fun.
But play is political.
The game is political, it can adopt many ways, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious -- maybe the place where the awe is redesigned.
And I want you to see -- this is Furby, a young female, who is playing with water.
I think, like she, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner and outside worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real seed of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a harder and greater world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our model of adaptation.
To adapt successfully to a world that changes we have to play.
But will we take advantage of our game capacity?
The game is not frivolous.
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and ruthless.
When it looks like the least appropriate play, they can be the moments in which the most urgent thing.
So primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscovered creativity, friendship and awe.
Thank you.
In New York, I am a development of a nonprofit organization called Robin Hood.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as a captain assistant in a body of voluntary firemen.
And in our city, where volunteers compete to a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a racing race against the other volunteers to get to charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the captain, I was mad in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in the middle of the night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a parachute, in his pajamas, discourage, as his house was in flames.
The other volunteers that I just got before I was, let's call it``Lewis Luther"came first to the captain, and this was asked to go and save the dog's owner.
The dog! I was quiet.
There was a lawyer or a money gesture that, during the rest of his life, would have to tell the people that I walked into a comment building to save a living being just because I won me for five seconds.
Well, I was the next.
Captain made me an addition.
He said,``Bezos, I need you to go home.
I need it to go up, go through the fire, and bring this woman a couple of shoes . ''
I swear.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I was -- I went down the stairs, at the end of the hallway, I happened to the actual firemen that at that height, which was more or less finished to turn the fire and go into the main room looking for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back down the ladder where I met my moods and the precious dog in the main door.
We got out of the house the treasures for the house of home where, as he was waiting, his treasure got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter of the house of the house, by the brave effort, demonstrated to save his house.
The kindness that she observed by the other was that somebody had ever reached a couple of shoes.
So much in my vocation at Robin Hood as in my vocation as a volunteer bomb, I I'm a witness of acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but also of acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have achieved, or you're going to do, remarkable levels of success, I'd like to remind you this: Don't wait.
They don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, let it now.
They serve food in a dining dining park.
Be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's lives, but we're going to be able to influence someone's lives.
So you go into the game; you save the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, go back.
Mark Bezos: Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I I I I I I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were made in 1863 with a very simple idea: cement modules of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at the same time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the LIGO came up with this.
It was called automatic assembly brick.
And in a few years, the LGBT bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that you have made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
LEGO made it accessible.
GPS simply adopted the concrete block, the favorite in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to announce: the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of statistical bricks, which would take each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows to create much higher circuits and more complex circuits, a brick at a time.
But there's a main difference: the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't accept that, that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing literature.
I'm going to show you how they work.
Little are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're ready to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they unite through magnets.
So you can't put it wrong.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the output, the blue is the current, the pink is the input, and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue with a green, and very quickly, you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue with a green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle, and so we have a regulators.
If we change the button by a pulse module, which is here, and now we have an endless light.
We added this doorbell to create more impact, and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, literature are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and soldier, literature allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
To make it blink faster or slower, it just takes this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind literature is that it's a growing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to turn into bricks ready to use.
Luck, sound, solar panels, motors; everything must be accessible.
We've given literature to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light works, or why the door of an elevator holds open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken literature to design schools.
So, for example, designers without expertise in electronics begin to play with literature as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and fever, we have Georgia creating ...
A few weeks ago, we took attacks of the Rhode Island School designers, who don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said,``Do something . ''
Here's an example of a project that they've done, an active conference cannon.
But wait, here comes my favorite project.
It's a landscape made from Play-Doh that's afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, literature became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be aware of all.
So, Titus has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and manufacture them.
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So go ahead and invent.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is trying to engage us with the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Hmm . Wait for a moment.
You can be able to run a little bit.
We can -- we can -- we can continue the video on one side.
No.
This isn't ...
All right.
Solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm going to tell you the time?
All right . Thank you very well.
A couple of years ago, I took an initiative to recruit the best designers and techniques to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything they're supposed to stop; we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called Code for America, and it would be like some Peace Peace bodies.
We select some members every year and put them to work with the municipalities.
Instead of sending them to the Third World, we send them into the world's wild wild.
They made big applications; they worked with the municipal employees.
Their task is to show the possibility of today's technology.
They meet Allah.
That's a Boston city hydrant.
So here it comes as if you look for a quote, but what you really look for is somebody clean it up when you're trapped by the snow because you know that it's not very good to fire fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he ask to help this very unique way?
Last year in Boston, we had a team of Michael for America.
They were there in February, and at that time, a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned these hydrants.
But one of the members called Erik Milliness noticed something else: that citizens cleaned with sticks right in front of them.
So he made any good programmer, he developed an app.
It's a nice application in which a hydrant can be adopted.
You accept to clean it when you snow.
When you do it, you put a name, in this case, you put it out.
If you don't, someone can roll it.
I mean, it has a playful component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of 21 scheduled applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology in the government does.
And it spreads viral.
A responsible for the City City systems when we saw this application was that he could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to adopt tsunami sandwiches.
It's very important that these tsunami whistles work, but people steal the batteries.
So you ask citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to deploy the shocks.
And Chicago just launched it to make people record to clean sidewalks when snow.
So now we know about nine cities that plan use it.
And this has spread without friction, organic and natural.
If you know a little bit of government technology will know that this doesn't normally happen.
software acquisition usually takes a couple years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that required three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool so that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that that we had done for normal channels would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the California's judicial power that the moment has cost 200 billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of governance.
So an application that shows in a couple of days and spread in viral form is a kind of warning of warning to the government institution.
It suggests the best way to work, not as in private companies, as a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without restrictions, open and generative.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the government question that has the new generation -- not as a problem of an uncomfortable institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just Code for America, but there are hundreds of people around the country who contribute to civic applications every day in their own communities.
They have not been given to the government.
They feel a big frustration before that, but they don't complain, they fix it.
And these people know something that we've lost.
And it's that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the DSM and all those other things that put us crazy, the government is essentially words of Tim Oxford:``What we do together because we cannot . ''
Now, many people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to recognize it, because things are changing.
Politics doesn't change; government.
And given that the government at the last example of us -- remember that from``We, the village?"The way we think about it to affect the way we produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government consists of choosing people to choose.
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially, of frauds.
This is the phone care center of services and information.
It's the place that calls the calls if you mark 311 in America.
Scott did this call.
I joined``Karachi"in the official knowledge base.
I didn't find anything . It started with animal control.
And finally, he said,``Hey, can you open the gates of the house, put very strong music and see if you go? ''
And it worked . So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the frauds.
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has an app, web and mobile, called Cities Connecticut.
We don't program that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the New Mechanical Mechanical Office.
One day, this actually happened, it comes up with this request:``Karachi in my trash cube . I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do that? ''
The dynamic of Citizen Connectic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In Citizens Connection, everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said,``I got up to the place, I found the trash cube behind the house.
Zerone? Yes . Live? Yes.
I turned the cube . I went home.
Good evening, shark candy . ''
Quite simple.
This is great . It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of government to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technology of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to help and help others.
So, a citizen helped another, but here the government had a key role.
He connected the two people.
And it could have been connected with the government services of being necessary, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, we force communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a much money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but you think you're the entrance of the other.
That our entry to the government system is voting.
How many times have you chosen a political leader? Sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that government reflects our values and satisfy our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like a huge ocean and politics is the surface of 15 centimeters.
Underneath it's what we call bureaucracy.
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that contempt, which keeps us that we're feeling like something that operates against us, that other thing, and in the consequences we're losing power.
People think politics is sensual.
If we want this institution to work, we have to make the bureaucracy sensual.
Because that's where the real work of government happens.
We have to collaborate with the government machinery.
That makes the Ocom movement.
Have you seen them?
It's a group of worried citizens who have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the SEC's order on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism, it's bureaucratic activism.
And for those of us who have resisted the government, it's time that we ask ourselves what the world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really think we'll get where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in the name of all?
We can't make government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can expand civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act, you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I, to regenerating, I'm a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost sitting.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to talk about; they're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem, they don't care about making their voices.
They're using their hands.
They put hands to the work to program applications that make the government work better.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a hydrant, taking up bags, dumping a trash cube that has a barber inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned those hydrants and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are as digital reminder that we are not only consumers, we are not only government consumers that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix government until we don't manage the citizenship.
So I want to ask every present, when it comes to the important things we have to do together, all together, will we be a volume of voices, or will we also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in jails, prisons and on death row.
I've spent most of my life in marginalized communities, in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm going to be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
In times, if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is truly important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach sense, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, if it's charitable, it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of right, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a dominant African-American family, which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, it had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She started many of the records in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia over 1840.
She was born over 1880 and his experience with slavery as the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but he was also loving.
When I was a little bit, and I looked at it, she approached me and gave me a good hug.
I was so strong I could barely breathe, and then I was left.
One or two hours later, I went back and looked at it, and I was like,``Brian, you still feel my hug? ''
And if I said no, I would grab me back and if I said yes, I left me in peace.
I had this human quality that made you always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the bottom 10.
In times, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there they were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
And he looked at her and smiles, but she was very serious.
After 15 minutes, she got up, went through the room, took me from my hand and said,``You see Brian . The two we're going to convince you . ''
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said,``Breath, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell anybody . ''
I said,``Okay, Mom . ''
She said,``Now I'm sure I won't ."I said,``Sure . ''
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and said,``I want you to know that I've been watching you . ''
And I said,``I think you're special . ''
He said,``I think you can do whatever you want . ''
I'll never forget it.
And then he said,``I just want you to promised me three things, Brian . ''
I said,``Sure, Mom . ''
And he said,``The first thing I want you to promise is that you will always want your mother . ''
And he said,``She's my son, and you have to promise that you will always take care of it . ''
As I loved my mom, I said,``Yes, Mom, I . ''
And then he said to me,``The second thing I want you to promise is that you will always do the right thing, even though the right thing is . ''
I thought, and I said,``Yes, Mom . I'll do it . ''
Then he finally said,``The third thing I want you to promise is that you never drink alcohol . ''
I was nine, and I said,``Yes, Mom, I'll do it . ''
I grew up in the field, in the rural South . I have a brother a year old and a sister a year old.
When I was 14, one day, my brother came home with a side of six beers, I don't know where I took them, it grabbed us to my sister and me and left for the forest.
We're just doing the crazy crazy.
He took a beer store, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me.
I said,``No, no, no . It's okay . You follow, but I'm not going to take beer . ''
My brother said,``Come on . Today, I do . And you always do the same thing that we do.
I've taken something, your sister too . You take a beer . ''
I said,``No . I won't feel good . You can follow . ''
Then my brother looked at me.
He said,``What happens? Take a beer . ''
And I stood up with force and continued,``Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with Mom . ''
I said,``But what are you talking about? ''
He said,``Mom tells all the grandchildren that are special . ''
I was left.
I have to admit something before you.
I'll tell you something that I probably didn't should say.
I know this will be widely spreading.
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking it's a virtue; I say it for the power that has identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they really don't see meaning.
We can't get them to do things that you don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all its grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoners during ban.
My uncles died from age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we had to engage.
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than what was 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in probation.
And this massive incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor or black communities, you find so much despair, so despair, determined by these facts.
One out of three black men between 18 and 30 is in prison or in a daily freedom.
In urban communities across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington , 50 to 60 percent of all young color kids are in jail or in a probation.
Our system is not just distorted in front of the race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a judicial system that's really much better if you're rich and guilty, that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not guilty, it's wealth.
And it seems that we feel very quiet.
The politics of fear and the force makes us believe that these are not problems.
We are disconnected.
I think it seems interesting.
We're looking at our work, some pretty curious development.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you're deprived by rights forever if you have a criminal conviction.
Right now in Alabama , 34 percent of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we project it over the next 10 years, the level of loss loss will be as elevated as before they passed the law of the right to the vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent kids.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where you feel 13 years old to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, without chance of coming out ever.
We're now in a process of some litigation.
The only country in the world.
I represent people on death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense, they have taught us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for the committed crime?
Very sensitive question.
But you can think of it differently about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of looking at it: it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by the crimes, but, if we deserve killing.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by error.
Out of every nine people executed, it's identified one that's innocent that it's extraordinary and liberated from the death row.
A rate of error, amazing -- an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation, you wouldn't ever be able to put airplanes if every nine to wake up, you would be to star.
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of whether we deserve killing.
It's interesting that in my classes with African-American history, I talk about slavery.
I tell you about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the reconstruction, and that lasted to World War II.
We really don't know much about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities, people were afraid of being swollen.
I worried to be bombarded.
The terror threat was what he defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and tell me,``Mr. Stevenson, you tell talks, make speeches . Tell people who stop saying that in our history, we were dealing with terrorism, after 9/11 . ''
They ask me to say,``No . Let me grow with that . ''
The age of terrorism continued, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial and separation.
In this country, we have a dynamic why we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we historically have done.
All the time we're going on with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about race . I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome racial segregation without a compromise with truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this engagement, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving conferences on death penalty.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said,``You know it's good worrying to hear what you say . ''
Adam:``We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here . ''
The room stayed silent and a lady said,``There is no way that with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, intentional and deliberately, we were going to run people . ''
Reflection about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, would run people, especially if they were in their most Jews?
We couldn't tolerate it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really worry about these things that are so difficult, the positive, positive things are, though, implicated.
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology . We worship creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are consumed by suffering, abuse, degradation, marketing.
In my opinion, you need to integrate both things.
We talk lately about the need to have more hope, greater engagement, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the last ones that will never get to TED.
To think of them is, in a way, something that's inside of us.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are . Even though we're so rational, so committed to intellectual.
With innovation, with creativity, development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from food ideas also by the heart convictions.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us not only on the brilliant and dreadful, but also in the dark and the hard.
Valley Haiti, the great child leader, talked about this.
He said,``When we were in East Europe suffering the oppression, we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in the emergency sites and being witness . ''
Well, that orientation for the spirit is practically in the heart of what I I, that even in communities like TED, has to engage.
There's no disconnect associated with technology and design, which allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, exclusion, inequality, injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts are going to be a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
Let's find them.
I had the big privilege, being a very young lawyer, to meet Rosa Parks.
These women join just to talk.
Occasionally, Mr. Carrillo called me, to tell me,``Breath, Miss Parks comes . We're going to meet to talk.
Do you want to come and listen to? ''
I was like,``Yes, ma'am . I . I I . ''
So she said,``Well, what do you do when you come? ''
I said,``Listen to you . ''
So I was going and I just heard them.
It was a very fancy, very lunch thing.
And in an occasion, I was there, listening to these ladies, and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks came to me and said,``Now, Brian, tell me that it's that idea of equality justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do . ''
And I started giving it my speech.
I said,``Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted unfairly.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We're trying to end with the sentences of life, without parole freedom for children.
We tried to do something about death penalty.
We tried to reduce the population in prisons.
We're trying to end up with mass incarceration . ''
I gave her all my best speech, and when I finished, he looked at me and said,``Hmm mmm me . ''
And I added,``You'll end up exhausted, really exhausted . ''
At that time, Ms. Carrillo leaned up, put my finger on his face and said,``That's why you have to be very but very brave . ''
I think the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We have to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst we've made.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to it, it's a thief.
Even if someone kills another, it's not a killer.
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be respected by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite to poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I actually think that in many parts, the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe that even though it's very dramatic, very beautiful, very elite, very stimulating, we won't judge us for our technology, by our designs, or our intellectual or rational capacity.
In the end, you judge the character of a society, not the way they treat rich, powerful and privileged, but the way they treat poor people, the convicted, the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really profound issues about what we are.
In times I feel unpredictable . I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
It was tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reactions in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been felt with a lot of sleep.
I go to jail, and I see my 13 and 14, who have been able to get judged as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone in what it's not?
The judge was accepted as an adult, but I see a child.
One night later, I was awake by thinking -- God, if the judge can become something you're not, you must have magic powers.
Yes, Brian, the judge has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think properly, but I started working on a mouse.
I had a 14-year-old client, a little, poor, black.
I started working on the location, with a sentence that said,``Mother for my 14 year-old black client was treated as a private white white white white white man . ''
In the location, I had been driving inside the accusation, in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was an advantage line on how this country is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
And the next morning, I woke up thinking that mission was a dream, or did I really write it?
For my horror, not only had it reduced, but he had sent it to the court.
About two months passed, I had already forgotten it.
And finally I decided -- oh God, I have to go to the court for this stupid case.
I went up to the car and felt really overwhelmed, overwhelmed.
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and beautiful.
I finally dropped out of the car . He walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a older black man; it was the court of the judge.
When he saw me, he approached me and said,``Who is you? ''
I said,``I'm a lawyer ."He said,``Is you a lawyer?"I said yes.
So I approached me and open.
And I'm whispering in the ear.
He said,``I'm proud of you . ''
I have to tell you now that that was a vegetarian.
That was deeply connected with my inside, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audience room.
When you go, the judge saw me.
And he said,``Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this swimming location? ''
I said,``Yes, Mr. was me ."And we started discussing.
People started coming . They were all outraged.
I was the one who had written those madness.
They came up with the police prisoners, the autonomous prosecutors.
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all strangers because we talked about race, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye, he agreed to see the consensus he was going and came.
He was looking out the window and he would reach out to hear all that scream.
I kept walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with a concern face, walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the lawyers' table.
About 10 minutes later, the judge decreed a recession.
During the trigger, an assistant of the algae was shown because the counselor had entered the room.
The assistant was left on the old black.
He said,``Jimmy, what do you do in the audience room? ''
And the old black stood up, he looked at the assistant, he looked at me and he said,``I walked into this audience room to tell this young man to keep his view in the target . ''
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds toward justice.
That we can't really be human evolved if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is linked to others.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity should be released to brotherhood, compassion and justice.
And above all, to those of the present people that share this, I just want to tell you that they keep the view in the target.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and seeing a obvious desire from the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes, to do something.
It's not a check . What can we do?
SB: There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a referendum this spring in which you're going to make an effort to reclaim the funds that you spend today in punishment policies.
For example, here in California, they're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this , 46 percent of the cases of homicide don't conclude in arrest.
56 percent of rapes don't come to anything.
Here's a chance of change.
So this refrigerator is going to propose that these funds are going to get rid of the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in criminal in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it's told it has to do with the biggest incarceration rate.
What would you say to the ones that you think that's like this?
BC: Actually, the rate of crime with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass incarceration in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war against drugs.
That's why it comes up with this dramatic increase in the prison population.
And we let us convince the punishment of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to lead people to perpetual chain, to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against property, rather than making those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of crime and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy on the punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Bread, you've been excited today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED . Thank you.

Peter Diamandis: These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, so they could be in the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that press media prefer to provide negative news because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day, our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can process.
And as nothing cares more than survival, the first stop of all of that data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called the amygdala.
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger detector.
I ordered and record all the information looking for something in the environment that could hurt us.
So a dozen stories we would prefer to look at negative.
That old one of the people,``If there's blood, sells ,"it's very true.
And since all digital devices give us negative news, seven days a day , 24 hours a day, no wonder we're pessimistic.
It's not surprising that people think the world goes from bad at worse.
But maybe it doesn't.
Maybe, instead, what happens is that we get distraction.
Maybe the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is accelerating in such a way that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying we don't have our good problems: climate change, species extinction, water scarcity and energy; certainly we have it.
As humans are very good, we're very good at embracing problems and, in the long, we ended up with them.
So we analyzed what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, average life is more than doubled, average income per capita adjusted by inflation has tripled around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kennedy spent 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we continue to get higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
Think about it, today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators, television, mobile, conditioning air and cars.
The card bars of the last century, the entrepreneurs on the planet, would never have dreamed of such luxury.
So supporting a lot of this is technology, and lately its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that comes out in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price performance in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in the pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, how soft it is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession, in depression and booming.
It's the result of quick computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before none of the big challenges.
And although it's free in a law on the left, it's curved up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly fast.
And in this curve, from Moore's Law, there's a extraordinarily powerful technologies that we count with today.
The computer in the cloud, that my friends of Autodesk call infinite computing, sensors and networks, robotics , 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, fuel, vaccines and food, digital medicine, nanotechnology and the A.I.
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in the Jeopardy of Watson?
It was epic.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that I had.
And I love this:``Watson beat human opponents . ''
Jeopardy is not an easy game.
It plays with the nuances of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called Singapore University.
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how they can use to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year, we asked them to bring a company, or a product or service, that can possibly affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been absurd.
Today we can point out a dozen companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create fancy life for every single person on the planet; it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that, which is scarce and adverse.
You see, scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon Three in the middle of 1800.
He's the guy on the left.
He invited dinner the king of Miami.
Napoleon troops ate with silver covers, and Natasha, with gold covers.
But the king of Miami, I ate aluminum covered.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet; it was worth more than gold and plastic.
That's why the tip of the memorial to Washington is aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is 8.3 percent of the Earth's mass, it doesn't come as pure metal.
It's bound by oxygen and silicon.
But then the electrons came and made the aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it was desperate.
We project this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 terawatts of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about scarcity, it's about affordability.
And there are good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the design generated : 800 rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity cost six cents the kilowatt-hours per hour compared to the 15 cents of the national medium.
And if we have plenty of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager Space spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after spent Saturn?
I took a famous picture . What's called?
\" A pale blue dot . ''
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet in a 70 percent by water.
Yes , 97 percent is saltwater, two percent of it is ice, and we fight by 0.5 percent of the planet on the planet, but also there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the nanoparticles.
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the Brazilian -- I'd like to share with you, I gave me permission to do it -- his technology called Sydney -- maybe the known is the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water a day of any source, contaminated water, contaminated water, a latrine for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just agreed to do an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have a full confidence that it's going to be, Coca-Cola will implement it in about 200 countries on the planet.
This is a potential innovation by this technology that exists today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world in the late 2013.
Think about it, that massive warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smart cell phone, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in an abundance world of information and communications that no one could have predicted ever.
It's better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of PLS dollars, HIV video, images, libraries of books and music, medical diagnosis technology, and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes when you get the applications in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Muslim Foundation, something called the X Common Tradition , 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the world's teams to combine these technologies in a mobile device that they talk to, and since it's A.I . they can take, they can extract blood from finger.
To win it has to make better diagnosis than a certified medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the morbidity load is 25 percent, and there are 1.3 percent of health workers.
When this device sequence a RNA virus or DNA virus that doesn't recognize, I'll call the public health and, first, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the billion.
The white lines here are the population.
We've just spent the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, going from two billion to five billion users of Internet.
Three billion minds ever before you heard the global conversation.
What would these people want?
What will you consume? What do you want to have?
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars injected in the global economy.
And they will be from healthier thanks to the Transist, from a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D printing and to computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three billion more members of humanity, healthy educated and productive?
How about a few voices ever before?
What if we give them the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What would these three billion to do?
What if they are contributions that we can't predict?
One thing I learned with the X Prize is that small teams, guided by their passion with a clear goal, can do extraordinary things -- things that could only do the big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that some of you already know.
It's called Fortunator.
I was at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's really important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of supercomputer.
They've played with this college professors, each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came up and started playing it.
And it's been shown that the human pattern recognition machinery is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that today we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the marketing innovation.
We have the capital capital.
And we have three billion new minds that will join us to work in the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
It's the running point.
And as the idea can explain in a minute, I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1835.
You might believe that you're chasing penises, but it didn't.
I actually collect fish.
And it describes one of them as a``common . ''
It was the groupers.
I was very fishing to the 1980s.
Now the fish is at the Red Institute of the IUCN.
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're pristine.
The brochures still say they're still intact.
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: the displacement of the waist.
Because I was there in 1971 studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could integrate.
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by palms, and as you can see, a few mangroves.
There were types of 20 centimeters, the black beard.
And the fishing of this slide was very abundant, and it would happen for a good moment, so it was made over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had declined half.
They were about five centimeters.
They experienced a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was compliments in the introduction of the delivery fish in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, it started in the 1960s, it did a lot of development projects.
And fishing development meant to impose the countries that had 100,000 fishermen, to impose industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite ugly, is called The Musan Four.
I went out of fishing on it, and we did studies in South China's South China, and especially in the Java Sea.
What we did there was something inexplicitly.
We captured, now I know, the sea background.
Ninety percent of what we captured were sponges, other animals that are in the background.
And most fish are tiny blobs on a few remains, remains that are fish of coral reef.
In short, the sea fund came to the deck, and then it was thrown.
These images are extraordinary because transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The fund goes from being a soft coral background, in this case, to be a light.
This is a dead turtle.
They didn't eat them . They were dead because they were dead.
Once we captured a living.
I was still not drowned.
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what you collect every time you go to an area where you've never fished.
But it's not documented.
We transform the world, but we don't remember it.
We adjust the game point, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If we generalize this, something like this happens.
On the axis, we have good things: biodiversity, amount of ears, the community of the country, water supply.
And that changes over time . It changes because people do things with nature.
Each generation will use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extract it forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss loss.
But you don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze change.
And in the end, I'm going to keep a little bit miserable.
And that, in big measures, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when the predatory societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very abundant, before extinction, is rare.
You don't lose plentiful animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this doesn't perceive as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous of great fish.
They become little frequent because we fish them.
Over time, they have a few fish, but we think that's the point of departure.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, will question that it was very different.
And they will do it because evidence presented in a way before it's not the way they would expect to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of you present, like you captain such, and you're looking at a lot of fish in this area, you can't use or, usually you don't use the scientists of fish, because it's not``scientist . ''
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in introduced societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the enormous paper that can get a protected marine area.
Because with protected marine areas, we actually recreated the past.
We get the past that people can't conceive, because the starting point has been running, and it's extremely low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine area, and they can benefit from the vision that they provide, which allows them to delete their departure point.
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle Midwest, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema can maybe fill the vacuum, the simulation.
This is a simulation of the Charlie Bay.
A long time ago there were gray whales on the Charlie Bay , 500 years ago.
And you'll have noticed that killing and tongues are like``Avatar . ''
And if you think about``Avatar ,"if you think why people are moving with the film, I'm going to talk about the story of Pockets why you're going to be moving with the images?
Because it involves something that, in a sense, has lost.
So my recommendation, the only thing to give, is Cameron, make``Avatar II"underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi . I'm Kevin Allen, the YouTube trend manager, and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we'll see why videos are made viral and what importance it has.
We all want to be stars: celebrities, singers, comedians -- when I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, contracted in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be made famous on the Internet in a sanctuary.
More than 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And, of those, only a little percentage is made viral, it gets a visit of vision, and it gains cultural limb.
How does that happen?
Three things: trend creators, participation communities and surprise factor.
Well, let's start.
Beau Vascall: Oh my God, God.
My God!
Wow!
Ooh, wow!
KA: Last year, Beau Voyen published this film film outside his house in the National Park of Yosemite.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the reproduction in the population rise last summer.
Beat doesn't propose to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if you call Mexico Mountain Beach.
I had already published many videos from nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy Kim.
Jimmy Kimmel published this tweet that would catapult the video to popularity.
The trends of trends like Jimmy Kimmel presents us new, interesting things, and they give them a wider audience.
Rebecca Black: It's Friday, Friday . You have to start the Friday . Everybody wants you to get the weekend, the weekend . Friday, Friday . So, you wouldn't think we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
\" Friday"by Rebecca Blake is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like``rainbow doubles ,"this video seemed to have arisen from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other peaks, they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday?
Well, it took him Toyoto and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson, from Missouri Science Theater, was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter video.
But what's important is that one person or a group of trends creators are adopting a view and shared with a wider audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 pairs of``Friday"in YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for every other day.
Unlike the 20th century in the 20th century, this community participation is our way of being part of the phenomenon by suggesting it or doing something new with that.
\" Nike Cat"is a repeated animation with a chord music.
That's what it is.
This year, you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know there's a three hours version that you've seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the Internet community community.
There were remix.
Somebody made a version of the old.
And then it became international.
Suddenly, a whole community of remix came out that made this happen from being a dumb joke to something that we can all be part of.
Because today we don't just enjoy, we participate.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted``rainbow double"or Rebecca Black or``No Cate"?
What would you like to have written to have written this situation?
In a world where two days of video come up for a minute, only that really unique and unexpected can get rid of the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this big video of a guy who protest against the multiple to the cycles in New York, I admit that I didn't care too much.
Casey Sitopital: I was bothered by not circular for the bicycle, but there are often obstacles that prevent you to circulate properly by the bicycle.
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect and his humor, Casey Sinka made five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth for all the new things we do in creative ways.
And all of this leads to a big question.
Beau Vascall: What does this mean?
Ooh.
KA: What does this mean?
Trend creators, creative communities of participation, completely unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media, a new culture, that we all have access and is the audience that defines popularity.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities in the world, Justin Bieber, started in YouTube.
They don't ask permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little bit owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, it's just the ones today, but they will define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story.
It's a puzzle that's still running.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece: a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a playwright, a man whose whole life had been supported in the unique and freedom hope of his country.
Imagine it as the communist comes in in San, facing the fact that your life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, are now sharing.
It was in the silence.
He died by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in vain, and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to stack us, but we supported it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to the deceptive slave, quietly to the sea.
My mother, Moi, was only 18 when his father died, and a controlled marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to a single task: the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that couldn't do it.
And after a four years, that defies fiction, a boat goes down into the sea descend of fishing vessel.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was pirate, rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother took a cold with poison.
If we were capturing, first we would take it my sister and me, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the engine, the proposal diving in every wave, and the horizon is vast and empty.
I didn't remember the pirates who came several times, but they were fooled with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to run for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finishing the journey was too much for him, and the first apple I tried, given by the men of the platform.
No apple had the same taste.
After three months in a refugee camp, we took out in Melbourne.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in Portuguese, an operational class suburb whose population is composed of immigrants.
Unlike the middle class suburbs, whose existence I found, in Forest, had no sense of the right.
The smells that come from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the foreign English fragments were exchanged between the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, twice.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT.
We were poor.
All the dollars were assigned, and established an extra tutor in English and mathematics, no matter what you should take, which was usually new clothes; it was always a second hand.
Two media pairs for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the ankles, because I had to last six years.
And there were weird and painful songs about the``rapidly"and some graffiti,``Asians, come home . ''
A house, where?
Something in me is a college.
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said,``I'm going to overcome you . ''
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted every night, but we were told about our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had nightmares, all of the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares would start to be able to wake up.
She opened a computer store, then he studied to be a state and opened another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition, angry and influential, and traditional kids trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and sponsors.
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classical Asian student, which was implanted with what I demand from myself.
In the other, I was angry in price lives, tragically enabled by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of lawyer, I was elected the year Australia of the year.
And I was caught from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but his edges didn't fit.
So I read an anonymous Restriater resident, it was now so much refugee, refugee and social activists, invited to speak in sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence she had never imagined.
I didn't know the protocols.
I didn't know how to use the covers.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of life in an iconic suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, going on on each one and throwing asleep, three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age as she had when we went up to the boat.
The``no"had ever been an option.
\" Make it ,"he said,``And you're not what you're not . ''
So I talked about youth and education, and the detection to the marginalized and the protesters.
And the more frankly he talked, the more it was to talk about.
I met people from all the roads of life, many of them doing what they loved, living in the border of the possible.
And although I finished my bachelor, I realized I couldn't stay in a lawyer race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown, a newly arrived, new on the scene -- and not only it's okay, but it's something that's going to be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside can easily mean to collapse the horizons, it can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your province.
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world gets scared, but not the way we fear.
possibilities that wouldn't have been allowed to have been stuck tremendously.
There was an energy there, an implant optimism, a rare mix of humility and courage.
So I followed my intuition.
I joined a little group of people who the motto``can't do ,"it was an Iraqi challenge.
For a year, we didn't have a penny.
At the end of every day, it made a giant soup of soup that we all share.
We worked until the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant ones, and we opened up.
I took the decision to move the United States.
After one journey.
My hunch hunch again.
Three months later I had moved, and the adventure continued.
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when the confusion was the social norm, and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew.
At 17, it became a cover of a Mandela whose mother was beaten.
With no support of his husband, he caused a return to demand it and take the cause herself, and much more back when he won.
You can't make it wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room in Sydney when she died , 10,000 miles, in Melbourne.
I looked through the shower of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew he had come to me.
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Portland, and we sat around his casket.
We told them stories and we made sure we were still with her.
At night, a monk came and told us he had to close the casket.
My mother asked us to feel his hand.
I asked the monk,``Why is your hand hot, and the rest of the body so cold? ''
\" Because you have taken your hand in the morning ,"said.
\" You haven't just left it . ''
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given who we were and how life formed us, we now can see that men who had reached our lives would have frustrated us.
The defeat would have easily agreed.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about ship.
Who could want that to do?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, the right.
Can I give you a piece in their lives, incredible diving in every wave, the endless rhythm of the engine, the horizontal vast that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see it, I would.
So, the mother Nelson and also the mother of so far is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in Rads about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the star sky, with the singer Sufi Ali.
We were having a conversation of how nothing has changed from the time of ancient Indian epic,``The Mahabharata . ''
In those days, when the Indians wanted to travel, we took a car, and we saved the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when Army, the great Indian war prince, he had silk, he took a bow, and with a arrow to the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with workshops and machines.
The conclusion we've got was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of me.
Every time I felt a little bit more.
I was terrified this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a letter if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't touch my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not kill it.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his pocket plate.
And this 50 year-old technological piece was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of pirate dishes and neurophonia in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phones, the luxury clocks, and the cameras prevent us.
They have our inspiration.
So I launched, I brought up to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than killing it.
It illustrates books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect to the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
where we are.
Put the text together with the image, animation, sound and touch.
storytelling becomes increasingly multi-polar.
But what does that feel like?
I'm about to launch Khaled, an interactive application for iPad.
He says,``Put your fingers on every light . ''
And so -- he says,``This box belongs to ..."I wrote my name.
And so I become a book character.
In several times, I get a letter -- the iPad knows where I live by GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl is excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magician and dragons, but to that childhood magic, those ideas that we opened with children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always became exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And, really, illuminate your path in what you're in the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated of a girl was that a whole galaxy hit a ticket.
So here, every book and every single world becomes a ticket that I drag into this magic device, inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In every fantasy book, there's always been maps, but they've been static maps.
This is a map that grows, fall, and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book, it also reveals.
Now I'm going to go into.
Another extremely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the ones here.
We've all heard of the fairies and the girls, but how many people outside India know their Indian counterparts, would you put them up?
These poor people have been trapped in the Indus cameras for millennia, in an old and wet book.
So we're bringing them back into a contemporary child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been locked, attached to their PC, haven't come out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go out, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of collections: sticks, stones, goats and shells.
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this ritual of childhood, you have to come out and, in a chapter, take a picture to a flower and then label it.
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then label it.
So you create a digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a fox and says,``Oh, I saw a fox . ''
A boy in India says,``Today I saw a monkey . ''
And this kind of social network is created around a collection of digital photos that have been taken.
Within the connections variations between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we've been able to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on it, and you actually see a group of animated stores that appear on the interior plants of the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and you'll blow them up to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where nature forces are intertwined with technology and magic and technology close to each other.
We're leveraging the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many equivalent projects fail.
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the Radio University was to design a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she had a little coffee cup or you and asked patients, family and known, what happens? ''
How can we help it?
And we tend to think, this is one of the biggest problems that everybody, or maybe not all, but most of the equivalent projects fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi quest . It's a very simple thing.
It's got a period of plane.
Every morning, I got up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get to 95 kilograms.
But it's so simple that every time I connect, I sends my information to Google Health.
And my head doctor has access to him as well . So, he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when you need a heart or some urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi quest, and before I go up to my car, people start talking to me: Lucas, today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of peers used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also the patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be employed to move people from their chairs and together develop some recreational activity to have more control of their health.
By the next week, it will be available.
This little balance connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people will, from their homes, take their blood pressure, send it to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they're going to recover control and to be captains of their own ship, but it can also help us to the health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of medicine care, the doubling of demand and other issues.
I'll perform techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also by crowding.
And one of the things we did wanted to share with you with a video video.
We all have navigation control in cars.
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where the ATMs are in Mahatma.
And also where all the gasoline is.
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the nearest DECA to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody knew.
Nobody knew where to get the DNA saved lives right now.
What we did was we made craftered in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience that: If you see a DECA, please send it out, tell you where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open in office hours and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 offenders were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we did an application for the iPad.
We created an app for Leonardo, augmented reality, to find these DECA.
And every time you're in the city of Mahatma and someone collapses, you can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use your cell phone from Microsoft to find the nearest USA, what can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just as $4:14, which is the name of the product, but as America.
And we want to start it globally.
We're connecting all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and act as a center for the U.S. crowd around the world.
Every time you're in vacation and someone collapse, it can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies all over the world that they could help us to value.
They could be service services or telephone people, for example, to see if the DNA that is shown is still in their place.
Please, give up on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my photography.
Or is it a photograph?
Because, of course, they're photographs that they can't take with their cameras.
My interest of photography woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15.
He mixed with my previous passion for the drawing, but it was a little bit different because when he used the camera, the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when you press the pulse.
For me, photography had more to do with being at the right place, at the right time.
It seemed to me that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that I would start by pressing the police.
Photos like this: a construction in a very transit road.
But it has an unexpected twist.
And despite that, it keeps a level of realism.
Or pictures like these -- dark and colorful ones at the same time, but with the common goal to maintain the level of reality.
And when I say reality, I say photography.
Because, of course, it's not something that can capture, but I always want it to seem to be captured somehow as a photograph.
Photos where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real?
Are it the details or the colors?
Do you intervene light?
What does illusion create?
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a two-dimensional surface.
It's not about whether it's realistic, but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality in which we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly unimaginable objects, something we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still seems three-dimensional; as if it exists.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So we deceive the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining photographs.
It really is to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture look realistic, I I think are those where we don't even think about, the things that surround us in our everyday lives.
But when you combine photographs, it's very important to consider it, because otherwise something looks bad.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, they can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos should have the same perspective.
Second, combined pictures must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet with these requirements; they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and end of different images with a perfect union.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is made.
This is another example.
I could think that this is a picture of a landscape, and the bottom is manipulated.
But this image is totally composed by photographs of different places.
In the personal, I think it's easier to create a place than finding it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that you have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the puzzle pieces.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The costs are a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even did red of the top of the island so that it would seem more.
So to make a realistic result, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well thought.
If you do a good job when you take pictures, the outcome can be very beautiful and very realistic.
All the tools are there, and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide on technology, very boring.
Please, if you can put it ...
It's a diagram that I took from a folder mine.
I'm not so interested in showing you the details, but the general aspect.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of the RISDED microscopes versus the power of local areas networks.
What's interesting about this is that this, as many other people we tend to see, is a kind of straight line on a logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude at the scale of performance.
talking about technology with similar curves is something novel.
Here's something weird here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
I would need more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we plot technological curves on logarithmic scales?
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to chart, the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if a graph, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a semi-and-a-half curve would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this happens, it gives a qualitative change.
If transportation technology would move as fast as microbes, past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back at that rate.
There are no precedent in the history of the technological development of a recycled growth that every few years is providing orders of magnitude.
The question I want to talk about is -- looking at these exponential curves, we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
One of two things would happen.
Or it's going to become a typical curve, and it's like this until something completely different, or maybe do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
That's what we're going to be in the middle of a transition.
On this line, we're in a transition of what used to be the world, a new form.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask, is, what is that new way that I adopt the world?
How new state does the world run?
The transition looks very, very confusing if we're embedded in it.
I remember as a child the future happened in 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's what we see.
In other words, the future has shrunk, year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is happening.
We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years ago because it's all going to be so different than extracting what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it could be, how it might be that transition that we experience.
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit of things that don't have much to do with technology and computing.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The time scale I'd like to do it is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we went back about 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a great sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that float around them.
If we look at the way that chemicals were organized, we give an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin with RNA . I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that time, it had floating some oil droplet with all kinds of chemical recipes inside of it.
Some of those droplets of oil had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside, and so on.
And they started to divide.
In a sense, those were the most primitive cell forms -- those oil droplet.
But those drops weren't alive, in the current sense, because each of them contained a random chemical recipe.
And every time they divide an unequal distribution of chemicals that they contain.
So it was a little bit different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow are differentiated by being better at time to incorporate the chemicals surrounding them, they grew more, they were more chemical and they divide more.
They usually lived longer, they were more represented.
It was a form of life, chemical life, very simple, but things became interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way we don't understand very well, these droplets learned to store information.
They learned how to save information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, they broke in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were so they could replicate.
The incredible thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable left since they evolved 2.5 billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for fun -- we can now write things with this code.
Here I have 100 white dust microseconds that I try to hide to the airport security people.
But it contains -- I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this DNA clip and amplified it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have many for all the present, and in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a dung, I would have put it in a virus and it would have spread it through the room.
What was the next step?
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy for another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things became very different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information forming the cells of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
That way, for example, they evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and put them off to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are a lot of resistance to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave us a place to form communities that would be formed, in a way, they were together on that, and they established a synergy.
And that way they survived or failed together, or whether a community was very successful, all the individuals in that community were reflected more and they were failing for evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came so close that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the entire community recipe together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have multicellular communities, communities of many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a multicellular community.
We have a lot of cells that no longer act.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles, or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and they were produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call an organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started to abstract information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more than processing information in community.
It's neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started to specialize within the community, being the structures responsible to record, understand and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as individuals -- learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn how to eat a certain fruit because I knew it was wrong and sick the last time the committee.
And that could happen during the life of an organism since they had built these information processing structures that for evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years for the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
And so the fact that the nervous system will build those information structures will actually accelerate the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most refined version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea in the head.
I'm sitting here by getting a few degrees, and hopefully building a similar, vague and confusing idea, in his heads that kept certain analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated, we become sound, in sound sequences, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as an organism.
In fact, as a humanity, we've started to make abstractions.
We now spend similar periods to multicellular organisms; we abstract our methods of record, presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The telephone, the computer, the video tape, the CDF, and so on . It's the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that connects us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You see the evolutionary example of Tom in which I produced some evolution with the Conversation program, before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told them took a billion years every one.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next, the language and so forth, took less than a million years.
And the next ones, like the electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is retrofitting; I guess that altruism is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process retrofits.
But I earned my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that I used to design to design them wouldn't be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now I design objects of such a complexity that would be impossible for me to design them in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that connections machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of the Machine Machine, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you couldn't have before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes jobs we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random facility sequence.
We say,``Please computer, can you run a hundred million sequences of instructions in random?
Could you run these sequences of infrastructure in random, to run all those programs, and take those who else you're going to do? ''
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, order numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, could take two numbers in the right order.
And I said,``Computers, could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that you'd better did the task? ''
Let's guide those and eliminate the rest.
And now we're playing the ones that the better ordered the numbers.
And we're going back to reproduce them following a process of analog to sex . ''
Let's take two programs, who are going to give up children, who exchange subsidies, and that children inherit the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of products of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say,``Please repeat the process . ''
He grades again.
It's introduced some mutations.
And it tries again and repeated with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or, in complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that ordered numbers in absolutely perfect ways.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They're dark, weird programs.
But they turn the comet.
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal, because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depended on doing it.
I was going in a 747 with Margaret Minsky, and he pulled a card and he says,``Look this.
He says,``This plane has hundreds of thousands of letters that work together to offer a safe flight . ''
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make good design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the options that there are.
In that sense, it goes ahead of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and can be able to run these programs much faster.
So it's recovered.
The thing gets faster and faster, and I think it seems so confusing.
Because all these technologies are retreating.
We are wasting.
And we're at an analog moment to the single-celled organisms when they become multicellular.
We are the amoebas and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant for us to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we're all part of the creation of whatever.
But now it comes lunch, and I think I'll stop here before I get rid.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've been running enough enough to allow me to get part of my fake bias on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, we talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World Series approach.
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about to come out,``Remove rules"-- talk about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'll focus on one of them, and I hope that many of you know it.
It's called a battery average.
And we talked about 300, a garbage that was 300.
That means that the baseball bat effectively bat, three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball in the game field without being caught, and anyone who tries to launch it to the first base, doesn't get in time, and the second base will be saved.
Three attempts 10.
You know what they call a $300 bottle in the Great League?
Well, really good, maybe the team of the stars.
You know what they call a $400 baseball baseball?
By the way, that's somebody from 10 hits, four.
Legislate -- like the legendary Ted Williams Lego, the last player in the Great League of baseball in running over 400 hits in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you have applications, and you're derivatives to a surgeon that has a 400 record record.
That doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place, and a lovely will have two clogged coronary arteries, and their family doctor gives it to a cardiologist whose record in Afghanistan is 200.
But you know something?
She's getting remarkably improving this year.
And their roots have been 251.
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think that should be the average of a heart surgeon, or orthopedic surgeon, a nurse or a genetic restaurant?
1,000, very good.
And the truth of the thing is that nobody in all medicine knows the walls of a good surgeon or a doctor or a paradigm.
What we do, though, is to send them into the world, and I'm included, with the mandate of being perfect.
That, ever, they make a mistake and an understanding of how to do it well.
That was the message that I absorbed when I was in the medical school.
I was a computer researcher student.
Once, a fellow in high school said Brian Goldberg was studying to a blood test.
That's what.
I studied in my little disadvantage, in the dorms of the General General Hospital, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, memory of the origin and the muscle work, the branching of every artery that comes out of the abortion, the diagnosis that are prevalent and the non-tech.
And I even knew the diagnosis of the difference about how to classify kidney tubes.
And as much as it took more and more knowledge.
And I was very good; I graduated with honor.
And I came back from the school of medicine with the impression that if you memorize everything, then you would know everything, or the most possible, close to everything, because that's what I'm going to do with mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mr. Dullabara.
I was a resident in a university hospital here in Toronto, when they brought the Mars Derek to the emergency service where I worked.
At that time, I was assigned to the cardiology service.
And when I was an emergency, I took a cardiologist to attend to that patient.
And I can inform the chief of residents.
When I saw the Death lady, I was sleeping.
I heard a responsible sound.
And when I used it, I heard a broken sound on both sides, which gave me an congestion heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, and instead of buying blood forward, blood goes to the lungs, these are filled with blood, and so there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to diagnose.
I did it, and I went to work on the treatment I would give.
I gave him aspirin and medicine to relieve pressure in his heart.
I gave him directors, water pills, so I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when he made the first mistake; he sent her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't raise the phone or do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and meet it with him so I saw her.
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to deliver complementary information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that required constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibility, which could take care of my patients without even contacted my boss.
The second mistake I ate was worse.
When I send it home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my interior that said,``Golf, it's not a good idea . Don't do it . ''
In fact, I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse that I was leading to the Dord Derek,``Do you think it's okay if you go home? ''
And the nurse thought, and then he said,``Yes, I think I'll be okay . ''
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So I signed the high, and the ambulance along with the paradises took it home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that evening, I had a bad present in the stomach.
But I went on with my work.
At the end of the day, I started to leave the hospital and walked towards the parking parking where my car was to go home . At that time I did something that I didn't normally do.
I went through the emergency service of the road home.
And there another nurse, not that I was talking about the Derepur lady before, but another one . He told me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors feared.
Other specialists fear it as well, but there's a particular one in emergent, and we see patients that are safe.
The three words are: Do you remember?
\" Do you remember the patient who sent your house? ''
I asked the other nurse with total nature.
\" Well, she went back ,"with the same tone of voice.
She was good.
But I came back and on the edge of death.
In the end of an hour of having come home, after I gave him the high, he suffered a collapse and his family called 911; the paradises brought it to emergency with a 50-year-old artificial pressure, which means a severe shock.
I barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff deployed all their resources.
They gave him medication to climb the blood pressure.
And they put an artificial breath.
I was consumed and taken up to the spinal cord.
I had a mixture of feelings because then the stabilize was in intensive therapy and waiting against all hope that would recover.
And in the two or three days, it was evident that I would never wake up.
He had an irreversible brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they were resistant to what was happening.
And the ninth day, they left it go . The lady Duller, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those they die.
That was my first experience.
The next weeks, I was punished by it, and I experienced for the first time the evil embarrassment that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, isolated, without feeling that healthy shame because you can't talk to your colleagues.
You make the peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The bad embarrassment that I talk about is the one that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my boss; he was a love.
I talked to the family, and I'm sure that I'm going to make things and make sure I'm not going to hurt.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my boss? Why did he send her home?
And in my worst moments: why did I make a stupid mistake?
Why chose medicine?
Slowly, that feeling was dispersed.
And I started feeling better.
And in a cloudy day, the sky opened and finally came out, and I wondered if I was better again.
And I made a deal with myself where if I played the efforts to be perfect to not make more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And so it was.
I went back to work.
But it happened.
Two years later, it was helped in the emergency department in a North Toronto hospital, and I received a 25 year-old man with a pain in the throat.
I was very busy and busy.
And he pointed out here.
I looked at his throat, a little bit colorful.
He wrote him penicillin and sent him back home.
But as he headed to the door, he kept pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my guard change, my boss asked me to talk to me in his office.
And I kept the three words: Do you remember?
Do you remember the patient who saw for a pain in the throat?
Well, he came back and didn't have a protocolicit paradigm.
It had a potentially deadly condition called the optimism.
You can look for it in Google . It's an infection, not the throat, but from the top air, and it can cause the close of those pathways.
He, fortunately, failed.
It's addicted by antibiotics, and it's recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and reproductions, then I was relieved and returned to work, until over and over and over again and again.
Twice in the same emergency turn, not diagnosis.
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because it's 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's a discovery.
One of them thought I had a kidney calculation.
They order a radio X-ray, but it turned out, a colleague that was checking the patient perceived some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He was order to restore and asked my colleague to check it.
And I checked it and noticed some sensitivity on the bottom right quadrant, called the surgeon.
They both were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was terrified, I was overwhelmed.
But I'd like to tell you that I ate the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a crap.
The most significant have been over the last five years.
Just, embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: if I can't release and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the voice that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my colleagues?
How do I teach you this to don't commit the same mistakes?
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, in a party listening to talk about the mistakes of other doctors, but they won't listen to someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a translation in my hospital argued the wrong leg, believe me that I would have difficulty in looking at her eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system in which there are two positions: those who make mistakes and the ones that you can't sleep and the ones that you cannot sleep, and those who have a little results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we take out of medicine to people who make mistakes, we will stay a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about spread and medical journalism, I've done a very bad medical study study and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Star Tower to my program,``White Court, Black Art"--.
And what I learned is that mistakes are ubiquitous.
We worked in a system where mistakes are going on every day, where one of every 10 drugs predicted in the hospital are wrong, or disappearation is not right . In a system where hospital-acquired infections are increasingly, and more numerous, causing chaos and death.
In this country , 24,000 Canadians are dying by preventable medical mistakes.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
And in both cases, it's about boring sustainability, because we're not getting the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A hospital system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't act.
sleep deprivation is all involved.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain on the chest, and it comes with local eyes, and with allies to alcohol, and suddenly my story is kind of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot; I don't do things always equal.
And my patients are not cars . They don't relate their symptoms always in the same way.
For all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as they taught us, and we eliminate all of the professional professionals to error, well, no one will stay.
And how about that people don't want to talk about their more serious cases?
In my program,``Black Delay, black art ,"it's a habit, and it's a custom, and I would tell you all, from the paradises to the head of heart surgery,``This is my worst mistake ,"blah, blah, blah --``What are your mistakes?"And it would lead the microphone to them.
And their students stopped, they would go back, they would go down their head and they would go out and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You want to be able to say,``Look, don't make the same mistake . ''
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a reductional medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The redefined doctor is human, you know human, it's accepted, and it's not proud of its mistakes, but it's effort to learn from what happened to teach others.
Compare your experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
It points out the mistakes of other people not trying to catch them, but in a loving way and support for everyone to benefit.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans are running the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes of the time when.
My name is Brian Goldberg.
I'm a refrigerators.
I'm a human.
I'm sorry, but I'm really excited about learning something that can transmit others.
I don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three personal words: I I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take one day?
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
And recently, I made a survey over 2,000 people, and the average amount of choice that says to choose an average American, is about 70 a day.
Not long ago, in a research, they followed for a week to a group of business presidents.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of these executives, and the time they were involved in making decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, they take 1.3 jobs a week.
Naturally, every job includes many mentality.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many belong to nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you heat the way that you handle those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of current current: choice to the options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
While I'm talking about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, as I I'm blind, you raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise when I ask a question, if your answer is positive please, you have a pat.
And now my first question of day: Are you ready to talk about the problem of the options problem?
Thank you.
Being graduate at Stanford University at the University of Stanford, it made this very high level supermarket at least at the time it was very sophisticated.
It's called Dradge's.
It was almost like going to a amusement park.
There were like 250 different classes of mustard and vinegar, over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of bottled water, and this was when we were taking water from the faucet.
I loved going to that store, but in one occasion, I asked myself, why don't I buy anything?
This is the olive oil shelf.
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in sealed box that came from millennia trees.
I once decided to visit the manager, and I said,``Well, this strategy of offering all these options? ''
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the mammographers.
hallway.
They had 384 different classes.
We installed a post to tell, just to the entrance of the store.
We put out there of six flavors, or about 24 different flavors, and we looked at two things: First, what do people have been willing to stop to try to test the bell?
More people stopped when there were 24 -- 60 percent, that when there were only six , 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a marketing card.
Here we find the opposite effect.
Those who stopped when there were 24, only three percent came to buy mammography.
The ones that stopped when there were six, we saw that 30 percent of them bought marketing.
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy mobile if they found six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy a stroke, it probably comes to us, at least it's good to conserve the line, but it turns out that the problem of the option overload affects us in very momentous decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this doesn't convince us.
Now the issue of day: financial savings.
I'm going to describe you a study I did with Guardian Hubble, Edit Kamilia and Wei Jane, where we looked at the decisions about saving savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of fund supply supply plans in retirement savings plans, the 401 program, destroyed people to save for the future.
And we discovered that actually there was a correlation.
We had 65,000 plans that were going from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds were offered, there was less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the participation rate was 70 percent or more, not as high as it would like.
And on the plans that were offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation took off to the 50th percentile.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more options, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the greater the number of options, more people were locked up for avoiding actions or investment funds.
As soon as there were more options, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we will recommend to optimize future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative implications to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that you're putting the decision, that you apply it even when it goes against the interest.
It's more likely to make the worst decisions, in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick up less satisfying things, even though objectively they're better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that gigantic variety of May, mustard, vinegar and mobile, but we're not able to do the calculations to compare, contract and choose from that impressive display.
I want to propose to you today four simple techniques that we've tried, in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in your business.
The first one is, cutting.
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less.
People always bother when I say,``Cut . ''
They worry about losing space in the park.
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, you get rid of strange options, there will be an increase in sales, you'll go down the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When practicing Product & Gamble went from 26 different guys from Head & Shareau to 15, you saw a increase of 10 percent in sales.
When the Golden Cat Corporation elevated the products for cats that are less sold, the uses were increased in 87 percent, by two causes, higher sales and fewer costs.
You know that the supermarkets of today, it's about 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store, about 100,000 products are offered.
But the largest store in the world today is Alec and offers only 1,500 products; a kind of tomato sauce.
In the world of financial savings, I think, one of the best examples that have emerged on how to handle the options is David Labra's plant, the Harvard program.
All the Harvard employees are automatically embedded to a life insurance fund.
Those people who really want to choose, they're offered 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know often people say,``I don't know how to cut.
These are all important options . ''
The first thing I do is I ask employees,``Tell me the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees cannot differentiate, you cannot do their clients . ''
This afternoon, before I started this session, I I was chatting with Gary.
He told me that he would be willing to offer the people from this audience, some vacation with everything to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a description.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to give an applause if you're ready to take the garden supply.
( A few applause) Okay . Anybody who's ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that journey?
I think that actually, I'll hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first round, than in the second, but I can help and say they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the options.
For people to understand the differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very vivid, very concrete.
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when you use debit cards or credit cards, which when you use cash?
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that making it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with Shale Benkind and Alexander President, on staff of New York Canadian, who worked in NGOs, these people were in a meeting in which they were spreading to a 401 plan.
And to that meeting, we were having exactly as you used to be used, we made a little addition.
What we added was that we got to the staff that they would think about the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save more money.
With this puzzle, there was an increase in the agendaches of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their savings accounts, four percent.
The third technique is classification.
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine hallway.
We saw that in the Supermarket supermarkets along the north row, the magazine exhibition can contain from 331 different types to 660.
But, you know?
Because classification indicates me how to tell them.
These are two jewelry exhibitions.
One is called``Jazeera"and the other,``Sweden . ''
If you think the one on the left is Sweden, and the one on the right is Japan, they have a pat.
So, there are some.
If you think the one on the left is Japan, and the one on the right is Sydney, they have a pat.
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is Japan, and the one on the right is Sweden . But, you know something?
This classification scheme is totally useless.
categories must indicate something that they choose, not to define them.
You often see this problem with those huge funds of funds.
So, who are that who are reporting?
My fourth category: Congress complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if we just simplify it a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very complicated decision; the purchase of a car.
This is a German Gambony manufacturer that allows it to be completely ignored.
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that give each one.
colors, outside color . I have 56 possibilities.
Motor, change box -- four options.
What I'm going to do is to vary the order in which the decisions appear.
So half of the clients are going to go from many options , 56 colors, to a few, four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from few options, four boxes, to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to look at?
How involved you are.
If it's always touched by the defect button in every decision, this indicates you are overwhelmed, or you're losing them.
We found that those who go from many choices to a few, first the button over the defect and again, and another one.
We lose them.
If you go from a few options to many, you continue there.
Same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was to alter the order where information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to choose.
Even though it's going to pick up the change box, it doesn't say anything about the preferences of inner decoration, in all ways it prepared us to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more hooked with the process.
To summarize.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the choices: Curtain, eliminate strange alternatives -- Congress, make it real -- Clanning, we can handle more categories with less options; to consume complexity.
All these techniques that I presented to you were designed to help manage alternatives, or better for you, to use them in their issues, or for people who serve.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful to choose.
And the more careful we are in our better choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1980s, in the communist East Germany, if you had a typewriter machine, I had to record it to the government.
I had to record a piece of text text written with the machine.
And this for government could track the origin of the texts.
If you found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we didn't think that someone could do this, how much this would limit freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer of any big manufacturer, and print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow dots on every page that follow a pattern that makes them themselves and their printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to do a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can add the attacks according to its attacker.
There are three main groups.
They're the cybercriminals.
Like Mr. Dimitri Gulf in the city of Kiev in Ukraine.
The cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cybercriminals to make a lot of money, enough amounts.
There are really many cases on online, billionaire, who made money with their attacks.
This is Virginia Tasan, from Toroud, Estonia.
This is Alfred Pole.
This is Stephen Watt.
This is Brian Sunday.
This is Matthew Anderson, Tara Alabes, etc., etc.
These guys make their fortunes online, but they do it by illegal means through banking triangles to steal money from our accounts when we buy online, or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought in an infected computer.
The U.S. secret service, two months ago, frozen the Swiss account of this gentleman, Sam Jain, and this account had 14 million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. Jain goes out; he gets his paradox.
And I say that today is more likely that any of us is victims of a cyber that a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from bad at worse.
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of attacks in importance that we see today is not motivated by money.
There's another thing that moves them, motivate them, they motivate them, they motivate them, they motivate the laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have displaced in the last 12 months occupy a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main attacks: the criminals that do it for money, the professions like Anonymous who do it to protest, and the last group is the national states that attack.
And then we see cases like the Digital.
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
Diction is a certificate authority from the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
It's going to declare the last autumn because of a taste.
They survived the security of the site and perpetuate a cyber.
Last week, I asked, in a meeting with the representatives of the Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if they were planning the death of people because of the attack to Diction.
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die by an attack of these?
Imagine is a certified authority.
They sell certified.
What do the certificate serve?
Well, you need if you have a website with patterns, SARS encrypted services, services like Gmail.
Except to intercept a foreign certified authority.
They emit approaches.
And in the case of Diction, it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in Egypt?
Well, in Egypt, the protesters took the Egyptian secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the hall of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers, there was this folder called``TEDWomen . ''
And within that folder, there were notes from a company in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept large-scale communications communications.
They had sold this tool for 250,000 euros to the Egyptian government.
The company is right here.
So Western governments provide tools to totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, the Scott Scott was found, a triangle used by the German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a good criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is interested.
But today, it goes further.
The Internet connection is intercept.
You'll use even tools like the Scott Scott to infect our computer with a trial to allow you to see all the communication, and listen online arguments, to get our data.
When we think about things like this, the obvious answer should be,``Well, it seems bad, but I don't really affect me because I'm a honest citizen.
Why worry?
I have nothing to hide . ''
And that argument does not make sense.
It's in play the privacy.
privacy is not arguing.
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
Now, as well as we could trust our governments today in 2011, whatever right we have today, it will forever.
Do we rely on blindly in any future government, in an administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live . I live in Kenya, in the south of Nairobi National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The Nairobi National Park has no fences in most of the south, which means that wild animals like the brains migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like lions, follow them, and this is what they do.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we got up in the morning and we found it dead, I felt very bad because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the masses, we think we come from the sky with our animals and all the land to catch them, and that's why we value them so much.
So I grew up hate a lot of lions.
The dying are warriors that protect our community and livestock, and they're also upset with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in Nairobi National Park.
A child in my community, from six to nine, he's responsible from the cattle of his father, and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way of solving this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions would fear them.
But I realized that actually this didn't serve, because I even helped lions to see the stable.
I didn't laugh . It continued.
A second idea was to use a space.
I tried to deceive the lions to believe that I was close to the stable.
But lions are very smart . They came the first day, and they saw the space, and they went, but the second day, they came back and said,``This thing doesn't move, it's always here . So they jumped up and killed animals . ''
So one night I was walking around the stadium with a torch and that day the lions didn't come.
I discovered that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that I would learn with and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a broken line.
It's all worth.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery supply the electricity to the little Indian box . I call it a transformation.
And the Indian box makes the lights down.
As you can see, the lightbulbs go out, because that's where lions come from.
And this is what the lions look like when they come from night.
The lights floods and they deceive the lions to think that I'm walking around the stable, but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had problems with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, and he asked me if he could put the lights.
I said yes.
I put them . You can see the background, these are the lions for lions.
Since then, I I've installed them at seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now all over Kenya, to scare other predators like hyenas, leopards, and it's also being used for the farms of farms.
Thanks to this invention, I had the fortune to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Brocher International School, and I I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping raise funds and awareness.
I even took my friends to my community and install lights in the houses that don't have, and I teach them how to put them.
So, a year ago, I was just a kid in the prizes of the savanna carrying my father's cows, and I used to see airplanes flying, and he told me that some day I would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to become an engineer engineer and pilot when it grows.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
As well . What my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you get a scholarship . Richard Turkey: Yeah.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on your list?
RB: My next invention is -- I I want to make an electric fence . CA: An electric fence?
RB: I know that the electric fences were invented, but I I I.
CA: I already try it once, right? And you -- LT: I've tried it before, but stop because I got a calm . CA: On the foot . Richard Turkey, you're a big thing.
We're going to be excited at every step that you know, my friend.
Thank you very much . RD: Thank you very much.
When I was a little bit, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called``Don't envy anything . ''
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying Kim NINJA history, but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world except America, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
Although sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor, and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter of my sister's colleague.
He said,``When you read this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're bound together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're prepared to die . ''
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a kid in his arms, looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
Nobody helped them, because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine in North Korea in the mid-'70s.
At the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survivors, eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more frequent, all my energy cuts, all around me was completely at dark at night except in the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the Amazon River, which is from the limit of North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very analog at certain points, allowing Koreans to cross secretly.
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how North Korea comes out of North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine, I was sent to China to live with distant relatives.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family without my family.
I had no idea what life would be as an ordinary refugee.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the northern refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed, and it would be represented to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was made, when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I was interrogated in the police station.
Somebody had charged me for being north, then they looked at my skills in Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was terrified.
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and deported.
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and I answered the questions.
At the end of the interrogation, an officer told another one,``This was a fake report . She's not north . ''
And they left me . It was a miracle.
Some Koreans in China are looking for asylum in foreign embassy.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and sport.
These women were very lucky.
Although they had caught them, they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These Koreans weren't so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and deported to North Korea, where they're tortured, jailed or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other Koreans haven't had so much luck.
It's tragic that Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, everything can be used in an instant.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I I decided to risk going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
Setting in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've become very different because of 67 years of division.
You even go through a crisis of identity.
Am I curious or ordinary?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call a pride of mine.
Even though I'll adapt to life in South Korea wasn't easy, I did a plan . I started studying for the university exam to university.
Just when I started to adapt to my new life, I received a call.
The North Korea authorities did some money that sent my family, and as a punishment, my family was going to be displaced to the force to a remote location in the outskirts.
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The Koreans have to travel long distances on the road to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China, and I walked into the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them, somehow, more than 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The bus journey took a week, and we were almost trapped several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
He asked everybody's identification, and he started asking questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came up to my family, I immediately stood up and told him that they were deaf people who was coming up.
I looked at me spontaneously, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way up to the L.A. border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in the Los Angeles.
But even after I passed the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned to cross the border illegally.
After paying tickets and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and locked in the capital of Los Angeles.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was held in prison at short distance of the South Korean embassy.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or crutches.
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man would say,``What is the problem? ''
I was so surprised that a stranger stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English, and with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and certainly, the man went to the ATM, and I gave me the rest of the money for my family and for two other Koreans and to get them out of prison.
I thank her all my heart, and I asked him,``Why do I help me? ''
\" I'm not helping you ,"he said.
\" I'm helping the ordinary people . ''
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The unknown friendly symbolizes a new hope for me and for the ordinary town when we needed it more.
And it showed me that the kindness of the unknown and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the ordinary people need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But to achieve their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and when they come up to a new country, they start with little or nothing money.
So, we can benefit from the international community with education, English language practices, job practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are in contact with relatives still inside, and we send information and money that's helping to change North Korea from inside.
I've been very lucky, I I've gotten a lot of aid and inspiration in my life, so I want to help Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
And I'm sure you're going to see more and more North and more North to triumph around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: light shops, quick food, ballet terrain.
So the planners in the city got together and thought, we're going to change the name of Central Center to represent something else, so they changed it to the South Angeles, as if this would fix what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles: light stores, quick food, ball terrain.
Like 26 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, the Angeles Center South, home of food places to take and eat in the car.
The kicker is that the food places to get more people kill more people than the food in the car.
People are dying of curable diseases in Los Angeles South.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times greater than, say, Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I'm tired of seeing this happens.
And I wonder, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if you get out of home, you see the harmful effects that the current food system has in their neighborhood?
I see the wheelchair bought and sold as cars used.
I see the centers of dialogue putting like Starbucks.
And I think this should stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I already get tired of driving 45 minutes of back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, I would plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a front line that we call a garden.
It's about 45 thousand feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said,``Well, I can do what comes me in win, because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it . ''
This is how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green Great, we got together, and we started planting our food forest, fruit trees, you know, the nine full vegetables.
What we're doing, we're kind of a group paid by advanced computers of all the processes, all of the city and completely voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then somebody complained.
The city came up to me, and in short, they gave me a quote saying that I had to retreat my garden, the category became Jewish order.
And I said,``Come on, right?
A judicial order to plant food in a piece of land that no one matters?"So I was like,``Well, let's get it . ''
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve Lopez, and I talked to the concept and one of the members of Green Green, who put a petition in Changerinary, with 900 signatures, we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My goal was even called to say that they would breathe and adore what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more based terrain terrain.
It's 68 miles of ballet terrain.
That's the equivalent of 20 Central Park.
That's enough space to plant 750 million tomato plants.
Why don't they look like this?
To grow a plant will give you about a thousand , 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar dollar will give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my anthem, when I tell people, they grow your own food.
Growing your own food is how you print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Central.
I grew up there . I raised my children there.
I was laughing to be part of this manufacturing reality that was manufacturing to me for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The gardening is my graffiti, I grow my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, which starts walls, I broke soils, gardens.
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my stage of that canvas.
You're surprised to see what Earth can do . If you let it be your canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing a sunflowers is and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness of how my garden became a tool of education, of transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You're surprised to see how kids affect.
The gardening is the most therapeutic and provocative act that you can do, especially in an urban.
Also, you get cold.
I remember an occasion, that came a mother and his daughter, were like the 1963 in the night, and they were in my garden, salt and looked very nice.
I, well, man, I felt wrong that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt embarrassed by seeing people who were so close to me with hunger, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me,``End, don't you fear people will steal your food? ''
I say,``Oh God no, I'm not afraid that you're going to steal . ''
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but in turn, I want you to pick up your health . ''
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a refugee shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was fabulous, they shared my stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with their mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed them, so just for a moment.
So, Green Green has come to plant maybe 20 gardens.
We've had, like about 50 people who come, work and participate, all on voluntary plan.
If the kids grow up, the kids eat hill.
If you grow tomatoes, you'll eat tomatoes, but if none of this are taught, if you're not taught how food affects your mind and your body, you eat blind what you're putting them in front of.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're trapped in . I I see color kids that are in this way designed for them, who doesn't take them anywhere.
With the gardening, I I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who fit their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington Heart is produced.
But if we don't change the composition of the earth, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into healthy care.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free things, because free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, you have to sustain it.
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, pull kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to do it sexy.
I want you all to become evolutionary revenues, guess, personal gardens.
We have to change the script of what is a management.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gesture.
It's a handle that manages to take their courage right?
That's your weapon of choice.
In sum, if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some shit -- to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your stick so you can plant something.
Peace . Thank you.
Thank you.
( Market sounds) (microwave noises) Probably everybody agrees with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of asphalt, and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, in which it rains a lot.
You can have a big amount of water in the asphalt that you jump.
And especially if you go into your bicycle and these cars, that's not very nice.
Also, asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a silent road.
The solution for that is to do porous asphalt roads.
The porous asphalt, a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pores and water can pass through it, so the whole water of rain flow down to the sides and you'll have a road that's easy to drive, and they won't get water back ever.
Noise will also disappear in these pores.
Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has disadvantages, of course, and the downside of this road is that you can get rid.
What is to get rid of? You see that in this road, the stones of the surface go out.
First one stone, then several more and more and more and more, etc., and then -- well, I won't do that . But you can hurt your windshield, and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create bones with that.
Oh . It's ready.
Bass, of course, that you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how damage is happening in this material.
It's a porous asphalt, as I said, so it only has a little amount of air between the stones.
Because of the invention, the ultraviolet light, to the oxidation, this attack, this battery, the glue between the laughter, will fire, and if you fire, you will be being able to get microbes and you're separated from the added.
So, if you drive the road, you'll get the added -- as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about autonomous materials.
If we can make this material approach, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use steel wool, of that to clean up supercomputers, and we can cut the steel wool into very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the baby.
So we have a asphalt with small pieces of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to cook -- an induction machine.
induction can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the baby, the baby flow through these miracles, and the stones will look back at the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven today, because I can't bring the great manufacturing machine here.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the show, which I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat samples.
We tried a lot of samples there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought,``Well, that's really interesting . We need to try . ''
So they donated us a piece of road , 400 meters of the Abullaran Highway, where we had to make a test lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there . You see where we were doing the road test, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage . That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of payload on them, and we'd repair them then with our induction machine and we repair them and we would test them.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers, including these fibers, using the energy energy energy to actually increase the surface of the surface of the road, even can double the surface of the surface . It really will save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, you have curiosity if this also worked.
We still have the sample here . It's quite hot.
You actually have to face before you can show them how the repair acts.
But I'm going to do an attempt.
Let's see . Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the judge in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News in his little gray radio.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because news generally depressed.
\" The Taliban were!"I screamed my father.
I didn't know what it meant, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
\" Now you can go to a real school ,"he said.
One morning I'll never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban came up from Afghanistan and they made illegal that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was looking at me as a child to escort my older sister, who couldn't be used to be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could educate us.
Every day, we took a different route so nobody could afford where we were going.
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that we would seem to go shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in winter, but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew that we risked our lives; the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally, the school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban subjects.
We always wondered what they knew from us.
Were they following us?
Did you know where we lived?
We were terrified, but yet, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was appreciated and a treasure.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total awkwardness of an remote province of Afghanistan, he insisted that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father was able to replicate it.
But my education mother became mastery.
This is her.
It will retire two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of all his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the Taliban, despite the risks.
For him, there was a bigger risk not to educate her children.
Over the years of the Taliban, I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated by our life and I was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said,``Yemeni, daughter, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money . You can force your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So, you still want not to continue? ''
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the ball, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I I'm here proud to graduate at Philadelphia College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was removed from his home for the courage of education to his daughters, was one of the first ones to congratulate.
It's not just about my college degree, but that I was the first woman, and I I I I I I I I drove it by the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global ambassador of 1911, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I runs SOLEs, the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to take advantage of opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families that, like the mine, they love for them, and despite it, and in front of a daunting opposition.
Like Ahmed . It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were walking from SOLE to his village, and literally, they escaped to be killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you're the phone, a voice would warn you that if you kept sending his daughter to school, you would try.
\" Look at me, if you want ,"he said,``But I won't harm the future of my daughter for his old and released ideas . ''
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that's often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who succeeded, there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and seeing that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, it's often the first compelling interests of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the Taliban, the girls who went to school are in hundreds -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I'm afraid that these changes don't last much, after the retreat of the U.S. troops.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who are advocating for them, that animated them, I see a future and a lasting future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities, and every single day of SOLEs remember me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never, I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in exile,``daughter, resistant to Gaddafi . fights against him.
But you never become a Gaddafi style . ''
They've spent almost two years since the liberal revolution inspired by the surge of mass mobility, so much from the Tunisian revolution and the Egyptian.
A bunch of forces with a lot of other light citizens in the country and out of the country to call one day of anger and start a revolution against the Gaddafi tourist regime.
And we did it; it was a big revolution.
Women and young people were in the forefront, demanding the fall of the regime, carrying freedom patterns, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a courage, to be able to face the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi.
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the East East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and some losses of about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and defeat the tyrant.
However, Gaddafi left a heavy load, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and self-interest.
For four decades, the tourist regime of Gaddafi destroyed infrastructure, culture and the moral structure of the society.
Be aware of devastation and challenges, I've loved, together to many other women, rebuild civil society, requiring an inclusive transition and fair to democracy and national reconciliation.
They were about 200 organizations in Beijing during, and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi, about 300 in crew.
After a 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops about development development, and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the Plate Women platform for Peace, a movement of women, leaders, very diverse guidance leaders, to advocate by the social autonomy of women and for our equal participation right in building democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the predictive period, an environment that was increasingly polarized, which is moved from the selfish policies of domination and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won about 17 percent of the National Congress in the first 52 years.
However, gradually, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, they were disappearing; every day we found stories of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the promise of ancient mosques and Sufi graves.
Another day we ran with the news of the American ambassador and the attack to the comfort.
Another day we woke up with the news of the military officers of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the military and its continued violations of the human rights of prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made by a revolutionary mindset, is polarized more, and it's gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
Intelligence, exclusion and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with our history of the``creative list"and choices.
So I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, we choose wrong, make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace, stability and security to Libya.
Is the creative list and the alternative between candidates and candidates brought peace and national reconciliation?
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still polarized and dominated with selfish policies and exclusion, both by men and women?
Maybe what was missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.
Our society needs national dialogue and creation of consensus more than the choices needed, that only reinforced polarization and division.
Our nation needs the qualitative representation of feminine more than need the numerical and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which is not just honor, but also put the mercy in practice rather than revenge, collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, destroyed by the war, needs desperately in order to reach peace.
Because peace has an alchemy that's about interaction and disruption between female perspectives and male.
That's the real credit.
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it in a social form.
According to a very some called``Salaam"-- the peace --``It's the word of the mid-ocean God, [. ''
At the same time, the word``Rama ,"which is known in all the Abrahamic traditions, has the same root in Arabic that the word``Rama"-- the uterus -- simplified the feminine and motherly, that encouraged all of the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the towns have done.
And so, like the uterus completely covers the embryo, which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion, all the existence.
That's how you tell us,``My mercy would take all things . ''
That's how you tell us,``My mercy is prevalent about my anger . ''
It's all about the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about an unusual question, which has an equally disturbing answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that everybody's doing: why she's left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who beat him?
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old . I had just been told at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in the Save magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first apartment, American Express card, and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I created my twin soul, pointed to my head with a gun, charged with ballets on top.
The man, I loved more than anyone in this world, put a pistol in my head and threatened with killing me more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of``crazy love ,"a psychological trap, a love disguised, where every year, millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm licensed in English at Harvard University, and I have a MBA at Markerth Business School.
I've spent most of my career working for the``Fortune 500 ,"among them Johnson & Johnson and The Washington Post.
I took almost 20 years married with my second husband, and we have three children.
My dog is a black word and driving a miniature Henry Obama.
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the religions, all levels of kings and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of malaria are men, and domestic abuse only happens in intimate, interdependent and long relationships, and he said otherwise, in families, the last place where we would want or expect to find violence; reason why, domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I would have told them that it would be the last person in the world who would stay with a man who was beat him, and in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, women between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be a domestic violence victims than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, boyfriend and abusive husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met Congress in a cold and rainy January night.
I was sitting next to my side in New York subway and began to shoot me with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had also been told from a university of the Ivan Reader, and he worked in a very important bank from Wall Street.
But what struck me most in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field.
He had big blobs like apples, and a wheat blonde hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things he did, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it especially at the beginning on a pedestal.
We started coming out and loved all of me: I was ready, that I had gone to Harvard, who would put passion to help teenage girls, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
I think I believed in me as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done.
And that was why the bachelor in that prestigious school and the work in Wall Street and his bright future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is to seduce and make the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is to isolate it.
Now the last thing I wanted to do was go from New York and leave my dreams work, but I thought I had to make sacrifices for your partner, so I accepted, I left my work and Congress and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling in a crazy love, who was entering head in a physical, financial and psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts.
And here's where those clues go into scene.
As soon as we moved to New England, you know, that site where I was supposed to be so safe is bought three clues.
One had it in the car glove.
Another one was below the pillow in our bed and the third always in its pocket.
And he said that he needed those pills because of the trauma that he lived in small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those clues were actually a message for me, and, although I had never raised my hand, my life was in danger, every minute in every day.
The first physical attack of Congress happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and I still had the shirt.
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's girlfriend from my mother and married me with him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were going to live happily forever, because I loved her, and he wanted a lot.
And I was very, very rearranged.
It just had been very overwhelmed by the wedding and the fact that I made a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I would never make me hurt.
I spent twice as much on our honey moon.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach, and I lost, and he gave me so strong in my head that I had a lot of times against the car window.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, he was overwhelmed by traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold.
Now, I kept pushing on by a week or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One out of every three American women is a domestic of domestic violence victim, or at some point in their life, and the Disease Control Center reported that every year 15 million children are battered , 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why did I stay?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly terrified man, and it was the only person in the world who could help Congress to face their demons.
The other question that everybody is doing is: Why doesn't it just march?
Why didn't I go? I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and smaller question that people do, because we, the victims, we know something that you normally ignore: it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a battered.
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is killing it.
More than 70 percent of the killers in the cases of domestic violence happens after the victim has put end to the relationship, after they're going on, because then the abuse has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include the permanent harassment, even after the abuse has come back to marry, financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to terrified the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time not to be supported by the man who was paying their mother.
And we still keep asking why don't it just go?
I was able to go, because of a last piece of paper I saw my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if I was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody: to police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, at all strangers, and I I I I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to stereotype victims as speed headlines, self-destructive women, damaged goods.
The question,``Why is it left? ''
For some people, it's a way to say,``The fault is her for staying ,"as if the victims of victims are constantly choosing to fall in love with men who want to destroy us.
But since I published``Love love ,"I I I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also scared, who learned an unintended lesson of what happened to them, and they refused their lives joyful and happy lives as employees, wives and mothers, completely free violence, like mine.
Because it turns out, actually, I'm a victim and a very typical domestic violence survivor.
I became married with a tender and nice man, and we have those three children.
I have that black word, and also that mentality.
What I'm not going to have ever had, ever, is a charged gun pointing to my head in somebody who says it wants me.
Right now, as you're thinking,``Hal, that's fascinating!"or``Hal, what silly was!"but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being battered, or that they were small or abused themselves.
The suitcase could be affecting his daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy particular love to the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse is just in silence.
They have the power to end with domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims need everybody.
We need each one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They take the abuse to the light talking about it with his kids, their coworkers, their friends and family.
They repair their vision of survivors as fantastic people and love, who have a full future.
They recognize early violence signs to consciously intervene, to slow their scale and show the victims a safe salt.
Together we can turn our beds together, our tables and our families in the safe and peaceful oasis that should be.
Thank you.
Hi . I call me Cameron Russell, and for a while, I'm a model.
To be accurate, for 10 years.
And I feel that right now, there's an awkward tension in the room because it shouldn't be dressed like that . Luckily, I I brought clothes to change.
This is the first piece of clothes on a TED stage, so you have a lot of luck to show it, I I.
If some of the women were horrified when they appeared, they don't have to do it now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels are very uncomfortable -- less bad than I I I don't have to use them anymore.
The worst part is to pass this sweater for your head, because it's when you're going to laugh on me, so you don't do anything as I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also surface.
I've changed totally what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
And I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer told me that I would roll the back and get the hair out of the boy.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that made me two days ago for the work, there's very little that we can do to transform our way, which, even though surface and unchanging, has a big impact in our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice and white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always make me, but I feel.
The first question is, how does it become model?
And I always say,``A cartoonists discovered me, but that doesn't mean anything . ''
The real reason I made me model is because I won the genetic lottery, and I'm the benefit of a heritage, and maybe you're wondering what this heritage is.
Well, in the last few centuries, we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to admire, we have also associated with a high and space figure, to the familiarity and a white skin.
And that's my heritage, heritage I've known to take money.
And I know there are people in the audience who now shows skeptical, and maybe there are some lovers of the fashion you say -- wait . There you are Naomi, Tyrone, Joan Sharmers, Liu Wend.
First of all, happy to know about models . It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each of them and each of the models in the runway, and the 777 models hired, only 27, is to say, less than four percent, were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is, can it be model when it's older?
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't love that.
But then, what I would really tell each of these girls is: why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the invention of the next Internet, or a giant coral surgeon, and a poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first one.
If after this spectacular list, you still insist, no, no, Cameron, I want to be model, then I say,``Yes, I know my boss . ''
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the reduction head of the American video magazine or the CEO of H & M, or the next Steven Meiji.
To say that the greater you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you get older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike the cardiac surgery, it can be summed right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've done your studies, and you have a rsum and some jobs to your backs, no longer what you say, that is, if you said you want to be president of the United States, but your rsum said,``More of the underwear clothes for 10 years, people would look at you weird . ''
The next question that people always make me is whether all the photos behave.
And yes, it's mostly played all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that took me, and also the first time I used a bikini, and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal terrain, but it was a girl.
So I love my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a party party a few days before the photos for the French Revolution.
Here I am with my soccer team and in the V magazine.
And this is me in today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They are creations of a group of professionals, petrols, makeup, photographers and stations, and all their aid and people of press and prostate, and they're able to create this . That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: Do you get free things?
I have too many 20 inches, and I never use, except the previous couple, but the privilege I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store, and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I traveled with my friend that was a very big driver; he jumped a red in red and, of course, they stopped us, and I was still sorry, agent so I could keep driving.
I enjoy these privilege for me, not for what I am . And there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from the 140 teenagers to those who were stopped and recorded , 86 percent were black and Latino, and most of them were young men.
And there are only 1771 young black and Latino men in New York City, so for them, it's not a question of me standing?
But how many times I'll stop you? And when?
In the research for this talk, I learned that 53 percent of 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure rises to 78 percent at 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is,``What is the life of a model? ''
And I think the answer you expect is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you feel very happy and great.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it looks like.
We say, it's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative, resourceful, passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say before the cameras, what I've never said in front of them is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever wonder, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair, will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the highest legs, the most brilliant hair and the clothes more to fashion, but they're probably the most physically insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I am one of the greatest benefits.
If there is something to retain from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable by recognizing the power of image in perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was older enough to get a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more precious pictures, and I wasn't me who brought them.
There were no artistic directors, no stars, no opportunity to repeat photos, not even a minimum care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took them random tourists.
My story begins when, meeting in New York City to give a point, my wife took this picture holding my daughter holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday . That's the corner of 57 and five.
I gave the fact that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter was approaching me, my wife said to me, why don't you take a New York on a paramic trip and you continue the ritual?
Here's when we started to ask tourists that were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture to deliver the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
Nobody has never denied, and fortunately, no one has ever done with the camera.
And so, we weren't aware of how much we would change this journey.
It becomes sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after 9/11, and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day, that a five-year-old girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to make us think about our own time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new milestone, and I can see the life through his eyes and how to perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something we expect with illusion all year.
Recently, on one of the trips, we were walking, when suddenly, it stopped in dry and pointed a red roll of the wrist store that I loved in small visits.
And I was describing what had felt at five years of foot in that same place.
I began to remember his heart beating with force when I first saw that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you're looking at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are memories.
So, I want to share the idea of participating actively in conscious memory creation.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family photos.
I'm always the one who takes the picture.
Today, I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and you don't doubt to close to someone and ask it: Do you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The divers are in the most threatened bird.
First, why are they so bad?
It's also been associated with Disney laughter, like mentally characters, stupid, stupid.
More recently, if you've been following the Indian Kenyan press, applause and self-assembly, these are the attributes that associate with the Kenyan Parliament . But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it . You know why?
Because Parliament members don't keep clean the environment . The parliamentary is not helping prevent the spread of disease.
They're very difficult . They're far from extinction . And, my favorite, the divers have better presence . There are two kinds of dives on this planet.
There are the birth of the New World that are mainly found in America, like the conditions and the faces, and the business of the Old World, where we have 16 species . Of these 16 , 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So, why are you important? First of all, you provide vital ecological services . Clean.
It's our natural garbage collectors.
They cleaned the cadavers to the bone.
They help to kill all the bacteria . They help to absorb the anthrax that not to be for them would spread and cause big losses of livestock and disease in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no bus, the carcasses take three to four times longer to decompose, and this has huge branches in the spread of disease.
The buses also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient Egyptian culture.
Nevada was the symbol of the protector and the maternity, and, along with the copper, it symbolizes the unit between the Stop and the Under Egypt.
In the Hindu mythology, Mathare was the god drives, and he risked his life to save the day of the 10 head devil.
In the Tibetan culture, they do a lot of very important open skies buried . In places like Tibet, there's no place to bury dead, or wood to create them, so these barriers provide a natural eliminating system.
What's the problem with the bus?
We have eight buses in Kenya, of which six are in extreme extinction of extinction.
The reason is that they're being poisoned, and the reason they're being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and wildlife . Police communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the divers are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of bus are on the critical list of extinction endangered, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years will stretch, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock consumption that has been treated with an analog drug like the dictator.
This drug has been banned for veterinary use in India, and they've taken a position.
Since there's no bus, there's been a spread in the number of street dogs in landfill, and when you have street dogs, you have a huge pump time bomb . The number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind parks in Africa : 350 terawatts are going to be up to Lake Turkana.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds . They cut them in half.
These are birds of birds.
In Western Africa, there's a horrible trade of dead abuse to serve the French and the feminist market.
So what is it doing? Well, we're researching to these birds . We're putting them transmitters.
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focusing on a problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about learning the bus, about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services they provide.
How can you help? It can become active, making noise . You can write a letter to your government and tell you we need to focus on these very unhealthy creatures, donate their time to spread the word . It will spread the word.
When you go out of this room, you're going to be informed about the bus, but you talk to your families, with your children, with your neighbors on the bus.
They're very elegant . Charles Darwin said he changed, because he saw them flying without effort, no spending of energy in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do, and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been molded for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
Since 1971 to 1977, young people, but I'm not . I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire, Algeria and Somalia, in technical cooperation projects with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every project we set up in failed Africa.
And I was disturbed.
I thought, at the age of 21, Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead, everything we've played we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book,``Wallarced waves ,"it was a project where some Italian we decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So, we came with Italian seeds south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the Zambia River, and we teach the local, Italian tomatoes and talents, and......
Of course, people weren't at all interested in doing that, so we paid them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't agree . We were amazed that local people, in so fertile, had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that they didn't grow anything, we just said,``Thank God we're here ,"`` Just in time to save the people in the famine of famine . ''
And of course, everything in Africa is growing beautifully.
We got these magnificent tomatoes . In Italy, a tomato grew up to this size . In Zambia, this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the investors,``Look at how easy agriculture is . ''
When the tomatoes were nice, mothers and red, overnight at night, about 200 inches appeared from the river and ate everything . And we said to the sandwiches,``Oh my God, we happen . ''
And the shipping said,``Yes, we don't have agriculture here ."`` Why didn't they say it?"`` You never asked . ''
I thought we were just the Italians we made mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans did, what English did, what the French did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed them.
You should look at the waste -- you should see the waste we're providing people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, I read```` Death"by David Moon, environmental economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donor countries, have delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I won't tell you about the harm that the money has caused.
Just read your book.
So, I'm talking about it from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are imaginative, collective missiles, and we treat people only in two ways: or we sponsor them, or we're patterns.
The two words come from the Latin root``pattern ,"which means``father . ''
However, it means two different things.
Patent, I treat any of a different culture as if they were my kids .``I want you too much . ''
Patternicgo, I treat all of a different culture as if they were my servants.
So the white people in Africa are called``Bone ,"boss.
That book gave me a slap on the face .``The little thing is beautiful ,"he wrote by School, who said for about every economic development, if people don't want to be helpful, let alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is to respect.
This morning, the gentleman that opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said,``Can we imagine a city that's not harmful? ''
I decided when I was 27 years old, I would only respond to people, and I invented a system called Factory Company where you never start anything, you ever motivate anyone, but it becomes a servant of local passion, the servant of local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? It's shut.
It never comes to a community with an idea, and it sits with the people in the local.
We don't work from the offices.
We meet in a coffee . We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we find out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give one idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's you going to do?
The passion that she has for his own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we help them find knowledge, because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of coming to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, do we hear them? But not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
Entrepreneurs never attend, and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they have identified.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't attend their public meetings.
What do we do? We work on one, and we work face-to-face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the business doctor of the business, which is established with you in your house, on your kitchen table, in the coffee, and it helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way of making your life.
I started this as a test in Spain, Western Australia City.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this contemporary garbage that we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects in march, and the government came to me to say,``How can you do that?
How can you do it?"And I said,``I did something very, very, very hard.
I was quiet and I heard them ."So -- then the government says,``Get it again ."We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter Dereption, one of the most great corporate advisers in history, passed at '96, a few years ago.
Peter Dereption was a philosophy professor before he was involved in business, and this is what Peter Derepur says:``planning is actually incompatible with a society and an innovative company economy . ''
planning is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now you're rebuilding Christine without knowing what the most useful people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to conversation with you.
You have to offer them confidence, privacy, you have to be fantastic when you help them, and then you'll come up, you'll come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 clients.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What's a presentation you've put up this morning?
Particular local people . That's what you have clapping.
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first world's first non-visual fossil fossil fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
It's a way of supporting machinery, not sustainable.
What we need to consider is, how do we nutrients, we run, we educate, we're comfortable, we communicate seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it!
The government? Forget it!
It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now.
There's an adorable story that's in a futuristic magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the 1960s.
And in the 1960s, this group of people gathered together, and specifically, what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was anonymous: New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and they pointed out, if the population is keeping growing to this rate, to bring the population of New York around them, they would require six million horses, and the manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already sent up in dung . So in 1800, they were having this dirty technology that would break the life in New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States , 1,100 automobile companies appeared , 1991.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed, and there were very few, scale, factories in appeared places.
Derek, Michigan . Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer them conflict.
Otherwise, they won't come back to you.
Then, you have to offer them an absolute, dedicated, enthusiastic service.
And then, you know, you will have to tell them the truth about understanding.
The smallest company, the largest company, has to be able to do three things wonderfully: the product that you want to sell, you have to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing, and you have to count a great financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This hasn't been born yet.
We've been looking at the 100 icons of the Carnegie world, Westlengers, Edison, Ford, all the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was invented by one person.
Now the word``me ,"but the word``us ,"32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody starts a company alone . Nobody.
So, we can create the community where we have families, who are coming from a small business environment sitting in coffee, in bars next to their dedicated dedicated ones who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this epiphy, someone who will ask you, what does it need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Okay, can you sell? Can you look for money? ''
\" Oh, no, I can't do that . ''
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those who are surrounding us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't exchange much knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like autonomous, templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their apartments?
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door in a bad time?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our landscape?
How do we share more our hopes to empty stores so that our communities can reflect today and our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I'm in love with New Orleans.
My soul always finds relief with giant robots that give shadows, mountains and gentlemen for centuries and trust in a city.
That always gives the music to music . There's a parade in New Orleans . The city has one of the most beautiful architects in the world, but also one with the largest number of abandoned properties in America.
I live close to this house and I thought how I could turn it into a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was Joan, as a mother for me.
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death.
And this produced me a profound gratitude for the living time.
He gave clarity to the significant things of my current life.
But I'm kidding for keeping this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to leave on the day and forget the really important thing for one.
So with the help of old people, and new friends transformed the wall of this house abandoned on a giant blackboard, and he painted on her sentences to complete,``Before I die . ''
So the trends could take a chalk, reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait from this experiment, but the next day the wall was packed and kept covering.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote in the wall.
\" Before I die I want to be judged by piracy . ''
\" Before I die I want to sing for millions of people . ''
\" Before I die I want to plant a tree . ''
\" Before I die I want to live outside the network . ''
\" Before I die I want to hug it again . ''
\" Before I die I want to go to somebody's rescue . ''
\" Before I die, I want to be completely myself . ''
This abandoned space became constructive, and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh to carriers, they destroyed me, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone . It's about understanding our neighbors in new and classic ways . It's about giving rise to reflection and contemplation, and remembering what's most important for us as we grow and change.
This happened last year, and I started receiving hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my civic center colleagues, we made a kit, and now they've been made in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together we demonstrate the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of increasing distances, it's more important than ever, finding ways to preserve perspective and remember that life is short and delicate.
Death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that trust us more power.
Think about the ultimate death of our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters to us as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, people around us not only can help us improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today I have one request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
Remember is 22 years old, it's high and very handsome.
It doesn't talk, but it's going to be better than some of the best speakers.
And he knows what love is.
You share it incredibly happens what happens.
It's not amazing . It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about the religious differences and look at this: it has never lied.
When I sing songs from our childhood, trying to provide words that I couldn't even remind myself, I remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be unknown.
Samuel is 16 . It's high . It's very handsome.
It makes the most important memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my chocolate, but remember the year that every songs came out of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I was standing in my arm during the first episode of the Texas and the birthday of Lady Gaga.
Don't you seem incredible?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit to the concept of society of society, they are often ignored and incomprehensible.
But what they drove to my heart and strength my soul was that even if that was the case, although I didn't consider them in the ordinary, that could only mean one thing: that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term``autism ,"it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual, it manifest differently, from there that Rome is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, it's diagnosed a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that faster increases in the world, there's no cause or no cure.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new being in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
I was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He was alive and he wrote in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing and eating anything that was going to be between media.
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences became more obvious.
But beyond the fog, frustration and endless hyperactivity, there was something really unique: a pure nature and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without prejudice, a human being that had never lied.
Wonderful.
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I would have wanted them to be just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change for normal.
Normally, the beauty goes through the beauty that give us differences and the fact that it doesn't mean some people are wrong.
It only means that there is a different view of what's right.
If I could convey a single thing to Rome and Sam and you, it would be you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- it's a gift! Every one of us has a gift inside, and, honestly, the pursuit of normality is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for greatness, progress and change dies at the time where we try to be like the other.
Please -- don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit about what has been being Alice in the Marily country.
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, who gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared . Really scared of these students with their big minds, their big books and their big, unknown words.
But by developing those conversations, I felt what Alice should have felt when she fell through the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with students, and I was surprised by the ideas they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our largest challenges, from energy to environmental and health care, among others, and if we don't know about this, work is not done, and I, I I think it's our responsibility as not scientists having these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not inviting us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please welcome with simple.
I want to share some suggestions about how they can do it to make sure that we can see that their science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question to answer, and then what?
Tell us why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just to study the textiles, but they study the textiles, which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat osteoporosis.
And when they're describing their science, care with jargon.
jargon is a hurdle for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say``space and temporary ,"but why not say``space and time"that is much more accessible to us?
Make them accessible is not the same as making them stupid.
Instead, as Einstein said, that everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies . They are ways of connecting and excited with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget from the signs of``bullet . ''
You've been wondering why are they called``bullets"? What do the bullets do? The bullets kill, and kill their presentation.
A film like this not only is boring, but it supports too much in the language of our brain and overwhelmed.
Instead, this example of General Brown is much more effective . It shows that the special structure of the boards is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a simple, legitimate sentence that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then, you will provide graphs that appeal to our other senses and think about a deeper sense of understanding than it is described.
I think these are just some key ones that can help us to open the door and see the country of wonder that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, all the media, immediately . Thank you.
One of my favorite words all over the Oxford English Dictionary is``soldier . ''
Just because it sounds very well.
And``soldier"means``dishonest policy . ''
Although there was a periodic editor of the 19th century who defined it much better when he said,``A flap"is the one that looks for a public charge without matter, platform or principle, and that, when I win, it gets it by the mere use of a responsible mobile memorial . ''
I have no idea what it means``responsibility . ''
Something about words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate language.
It wasn't until, for example , 1779 that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the parliamentary chamber.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the implementation of Brad Cross, who faced the Parliament.
They took him on the London Tower, and they were incarcerated, but he had the enough courage to face them, and at the end, he had such a popular support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use recorded from the phrase,``stand like the metal . ''
Most people think it's literal.
It's not . It's by a advocate of the freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to come back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of what to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Republican country?
This was debated in Congress for a long time.
All kinds of suggestions that could be frustrated.
Some wanted to call it``George de Washington ,"and others,``His alter George Washington ,"and other``Defense of the People of the United States . ''
Not very attractive.
Some just wanted to call it``king . ''
They thought it was the quality of quality.
And they didn't even have that money, they had the idea that one could be elected King for a certain deadline.
And it could have served.
Everybody gets married immediately, because this debate is broken for three weeks.
I read the diary of a poor senator, and I always wrote,``Still with this issue . ''
What caused the delay, and the thing was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate.
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to recover power.
They didn't want to call him a king for him, or his own ideas.
So, they wanted to give the title more modest, more integrative and more pathetic that they came.
And that title was``President . ''
President . They didn't invent the title . There was already, but it only meant,``Somebody who owns a meeting . ''
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more glamorous than the term``foreman"or``super-sort . ''
There were events of small colonial intellectuals and government failures, but it was really an insignificant title.
And so the Senate corresponds.
They said,``It's ridiculous, we can't call it president . ''
\" This guy has to sign treaties and meet with foreign dictionaries . ''
\" And who will actually take a little bit of a ridiculous and intelligent title as President of America? ''
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't yield.
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, until where I've been able to find out, the Senate has never really refrigerated the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate between in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is temporary -- it's possible that we keep waiting for 23 more years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this, I want to leave you, is that the U.S. President's degree doesn't sound at all so modest today, right?
Especially if you have over 5,000 nuclear heads to available, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of non-profit vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have given to the title of curse.
So the end won the Senate.
They got their responsibility title.
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of uniqueness -- well, it was a uniqueness by then.
But, you know how many nations you have now?
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear heads, etc.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost, because no one's going to feel humble when you tell them that they are the President of America.
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and I would like to leave you.
politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually, the driving reality is a lot more the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to land in an illegal mine of Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the rock of sweat bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk, but above all, that cacophony of male atoms and stones with primitive tools.
Like the other, I take a cheap line of linear light subjects to the head with this orange elastic, and I can barely distinguish the branches that hold the walls of that one meter that falls hundreds of meters on the ground.
My hand is crushed, and I suddenly remember a minority that I met days before, who lost control and fell countless meters in that manhole.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep of that hole risking their lives without paying, and often dying.
I went out of that hole and went home, but they might never do it, because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only exhibition at the Virgin Peace Summit.
Among all the amazing people I met there, I met an integral from French, an NGO that is devoted to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery, and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew it existed in the world, but not such a degree.
When we finished talking, I felt very bad; I was honestly embarrassed to ignore this atrocities of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I was made a knot of the stomach, and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the French, and offer it my help.
This is my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had already been in many of these sites.
Some, even I considered them my second home.
But this time, it would send the dirty troops.
A conservative calculation says there are currently more than 27 million people who are enslaved in the world.
It's twice the amount of Africans displaced throughout the treatment of traditional slaves.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of an American worker.
The equivalent of a $50,000 current.
However, today, you can enslave entire families by generations by for for $18.
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from more than 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of them have been fooled with false education promises and better work to find out that they're forced to work without paying, under violence and can't escape.
Today, slavery operates in trade: goods produced by slaves have value, but who produce them are disposable.
slavery exists in almost everybody, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met brick furnaces.
This weird and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the hell of Dante.
In a temperature of 54 C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families wrapped up in a heavy pile of powder, acceptable mechanically in their heads, to 18 at the same time, and they take them from the honeybeed furnaces to trucks that are hundreds of meters.
Deployment by the monkey and the tiredness work in silence, doing this task over and over for 16 hours a day.
There were no pause to eat, not to drink, and the severe desertification made it just rather intense.
So penises were the heat and dust that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to revive it, and I sat there, I thought, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the oven, I wanted to cry, but the analysis I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said,``Lisa, don't do it . Don't do it here . ''
And I was very clearly explained that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were already.
I had to rely on the French' and work inside the system for his release and trust you to get it.
As to me, wait to get home to feel my own heart.
In the Himalayas, I found kids carrying stones during miles by mountains, to trucks that they hoped down.
Those big plates were more heavy than kids who carry them, and kids held them to their heads with home straps made from sticks, ropes and rags.
It's hard to witness something so overwhelming.
How can we influence something so insidious, but so ubiquitous?
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 hours a day without payment because this has been that whole life.
They don't have anything to compare.
When these villages recruited their freedom, the climbers burned their homes.
When we heard the word of slavery, we often think of sexual traffic, and because of this global consciousness, I was very difficult to work with security in this particular business.
In Kathmandu, I was involved with women who had been previously sexual slaves.
I was driven by some anger stairs that gave this dirty basement, of fluorescent light.
It wasn't exactly a barrier.
It was more a restaurant.
Research, as you know in the office, are local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, private rooms, where slaves with their girls and children, some of the only seven years are forced to train customers and encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each point is dark and dirty, identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a biomass and a curtain.
Workers often suffer sexual abuse by hands of their clients.
standing in the supermarket, I remember having sense a tremendous acute fear, and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be to be stuck in that hell.
I just had a room: the stairs where I walked.
There were no brown doors.
There were no big enough windows like to climb.
Those people don't have a school, and because we play a topic so hard, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people who are enslaved in agriculture, in restaurants, in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sexual slaves.
It happens everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that we often relate to with the slave labor.
I visited Indian villages where there were entire families enslaved at silk trade.
This is a family portrait.
The black hands of black are from the father, the blue tissues and red, of their children.
They mix paintings in these big barrels and dip the silk on the liquid to the elbow, but the painting is toxic.
My performer told me his stories.
\" We don't have freedom ,"they said.
\" We still hope, though, to be able to come out of this house someday and go somewhere else where our work really pays us . ''
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children who are enslaved in the Volta lake, the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to a quick look.
Did I see what seemed to be a fish family in a ship, two older brothers, some younger kids, makes sense right?
mistake . They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their translated, desperate and forced families to work in these boats in the lake, even though they don't know swimming.
This kid is eight years old.
When our boat came up, he was shaking; he feared that his little canoe was extended.
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
The branches of the trees in the Valentian lake often attract networks and children, fatigue and fear, they throw into the water to unlock branches.
Many of them are drowning.
Since it remembers, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear to his love is not going to flee, and as all life has been treated with cruelty, it's usually treated to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they took up the last networks, but they had been working from the one.
at the cold and windy night.
And it turns out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're full of fish.
I want to introduce you to Kofi.
Kofi was rescued in a venture village.
I met it in a shelter in which I was facing the Sling of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will become because somebody decided to make the difference in their life?
It's driving by a road in Ghana with the Soviet partners, a paralyzed partner with his motorcycle suddenly accelerating and supported our car and played the window.
It asked us to follow it by a road road to the forest.
At the end of the road, we got out of the car, and asked the driver to go quickly.
And then he pointed out this sense, and he said,``This is the road, this is the road . Come on . ''
As we began to go down, we took the anthropologists that blocked the path, and after walking around an hour, we found that the path was attached by the recent rains, so I put the computer team on my head as we gave up in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of walking, the Swedish path ended up abruptly in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all full of enslaved workers.
A lot of women had kids tied to their backs, and as they were looking for gold, they walked into water poisoned.
The market is used in the process of extraction.
These miners are enslaved in a wells in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump, they were pregnant in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, irritated, because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have up to 90 meters, and these people are carrying heavy heavy bags that will then be transported to another area where they're going to kill the stone so they can extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled strong and virtuous men, but if we look closer, we see to work for other less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this muscle ends up like this visualization of tuberculosis and the market poisoned in a few years.
This is Marine . When his father died, his uncle took him to work with him in the mines.
By dying his uncle, Mandela inherited the debt of the uncle that force it to be slave in the mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the mines 14 years and the lesion of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the mine, so severe that physicians said it should be amputated.
In addition to that, Mandela has tuberculosis, and not even that, he's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Even so, he dreams of being released and educated with help of local activists like French, and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give them testimony from them, and we will do everything possible to help change their lives.
I honestly believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not magazines . These are people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that happens that I don't think about these so many beautiful, battered people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images will wake up a force in who you see them, in people like you, and I hope that that force is on a fire, and that fire streams light on slavery, because without that light, the beasts of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math applied, and there's a peculiar problem for who it does: we are like management consultants.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try and tell you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We dislike the virtues of the ballet and the classroom dancers that we'll see later.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably certain initial attitude that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease is gradually destroyed this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend Jon Stanford, who, in his time, was a virtual dancer dancer.
In the last few years, a lot of treatment has been progress.
However, there are 6.6 million people in the world who are sick and have to deal with an incurable weakness, tremor, stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in a objective way, and ultimately the only way that we will know if there is really a cure to be when we have a objective and open metric.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement, there's no biological markers, so they don't serve blood analysis and the best thing we have is a 20-year-old neurologic exam.
You have to go to a clinic to do it . It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, they never do . It's never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a very difficult journey to the clinic . What if patients could do the test themselves?
It wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to propose to you as no conventional form to try, you see, in some sense at least, we are all virtuous as my friend Jane Stanford.
This is a video of the vibration of vocal strings.
It shows somebody healthy as you get sound in talking . We can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds, and we all have the necessary genes . The Phoenix, for example.
And, like the ballet, it requires extraordinary training level.
Let's think about the time it takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal strings as they vibrate, and as the Parkinson's affecting limbs, it affects the vocal organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of the irregular shake of the vocal strings.
We see the same symptoms.
vocal, weakness and stiffness.
The speech becomes more quiet and associated after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with specialized clinical trials? Well, both of them are not invasive.
The neurological test is not invasive . Both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
They're both accurate . Okay, but also the tests based on voice are not specialized.
I mean, they can be autonomous.
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They are minimal cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so low, it appears to mass scale.
These are some incredible goals ready to address.
We can reduce the logistical difficulties of patients.
I didn't need to go to the clinic for the routine check.
With high frequency monitoring, we could get objective data.
We could do low cost feedback for clinical trials, and, for the first time, factory cheeses at general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first diseases of disease before it's too late.
So, when you give me the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Vaccan Initiative Initiative.
Together to Acclado and Pakistan, we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have local lines accessible for about 750 million people in the world.
Anyone, with or without Parkinson, can call low price and leave recordings for a few cents, and I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you . Tom Rielly: So Max, taking all these samples of, say 10,000 people, will you say who's healthy and who's not?
What will you get out of these samples?
Max Littman: Yeah, yeah . What happens is, during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease . TR: Sure.
MO: You see, some people cannot pass it . You may not finish it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data collected in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking at the confusion factors in search of the actual markers of disease.
TR: Are you 86 percent accuracy right now?
MO: Much more than that.
Actually, my student Tachia, I have to publish it, has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network also, what the project does . We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: Ninety and nine . Well, it's an improvement.
MO: Of course.
TR: Thank you very much . Max Littman, public.
MO: Thank you, Tom.
Before March of 2011, I made photographs in New York City.
We're pressure, gray creatures.
We hide in the darkness, in rooms without windows, and usually we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin models even thinner, the perfect skin, even more perfect, we do the impossible, possible and criticize ourselves in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a real taste by images and photography.
On March 11 , 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the tragic events that happen in Japan.
Just a little while later, an organization where I was voluntary, there Have Hans volunteers, it was in the place working as part of the answer team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers, we knew we couldn't sit at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May traveled to Ottoman.
It's a small village town located at the preference of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The recorded water level reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles inside.
As you can imagine, the town was devastated.
We get rid of the channels and the sticks.
We cleaned up schools . We took the slime and let the houses ready to be renewed and repeated.
We take tons and tons of dead fish, smelly, rotten of the local factory.
We taught us, and we love it.
For weeks, both volunteers and neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and pictures of photos and cameras and Chadless cards.
They all did the same thing.
You'll pick them up and take them to different places from the villages around them.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that those people had suffered.
As they walked out of the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I began to help in an assessment center.
It helped clean the common bathrooms the huge, giant walls.
This place turned out to be the place of the town where the center of efficacy picked pictures.
There they were taken, and I had the honor that that day trust me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression to think beyond the horizons, but it wasn't until I had my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some who had more than a hundred years old, some of them were still in the envelope of the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking as a player how to fix that trait and repair that feature and met hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive, that I knew we had to try.
So we started to play pictures.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too trained, but where the water had documented the face of the girl, I had to fix a lot of precision and dance.
Otherwise, that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the particular picture.
With the step of time, they came for luck more photos, and they needed more collections, so it was that it came back in Facebook and LinkedIn and five days later 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
Within two weeks, I had 150 people who were willing to join.
In Japan, in July, we moved to Rubik, a neighboring town in Northern Namibia.
Once a week we used our scanner in the temporal photographs that had been installed, where people were going to reclaim their pictures.
The time you were trying to deliver them is a different story, it depends on the depression of the photos.
It could be involved an hour . It could take weeks.
It could take months.
This guy had to draw virtually by hand using the areas whose color and detail the water had not destroyed.
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all these pictures in seawater, water covers, with algae, even with oil, all of it together with the time of time, and that's why you're going to clean them by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't pick up the photo unless it was clean, dry and had been recruited by his owner.
We were lucky with their hand cleaning.
We count with the guide of an admirable neighbor.
It's very easy to hurt the photos already.
As Windown once said, my group's leader is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures had luck relative to photos.
He had begun to wipe them up, but she stopped when he realized he was even more.
It also had doubled.
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face wouldn't have been able to rebuild, we could flap the images in one photo and play the whole picture.
When he collected his pictures, he shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in their husband found the photos in a bomb station between the rubble, which used to be their house, but their colleagues recognized it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the driver of closing the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the Sirens sounded.
His little kids, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took her a week to find his whole family and know that they had all survived.
The day he handed his pictures her youngest son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could do, something that he could look at, something that he could remember from the past that wouldn't have been marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers, there were a hundred of them, hundreds of them helped us clean up over 135 photographs, the vast majority -- -- the big majority came back to their owners . Great.
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to go back to 90 hundred families of completely refined pictures of pictures and challenges.
Over this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most in ink for printers.
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a place, a relationship, somebody dear.
They're our memories of our memories and stories, the last thing we're going to take, but the first thing we're going to look for.
This was about the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone your connection with the past.
When a picture like this goes back to someone, I suppose a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the players.
Some of them connected them with something larger, to give up something, using their talent for something that are not thin models of perfect skin.
So I'd like to read this email . I sent it up, the day I came from Japan after six months.
As I was driving, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women from different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathered around a baby, moved me, because a similar picture of my family, my grandmother, my mother, and my newborn daughter, hangs from our wall.
In the entire world, in all the few basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
Doc English inspired us amazing and curious, with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just a million seconds.
But now , 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present a new kind of photograph: the photographer -- a new technique so fast that can create videos in slow motion of the light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the corners, beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and really challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and turn it up and turn it into a billion or it's, in several fossils, create a piece of photons of just a millimeter wide.
And that package of photons, that bullet, traveling at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and we shot in this bottle, how do those photons spread inside this bottle?
What's the aspect of light in slow motion?
Now, all of this -- Remember that all of this happens effectively in less than a night, it's what tends to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't assume this research . It's a lot of things in this movie; it's driving this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our bullet, comes into the bottle with a pack of photons that starts to go through it, and, inside, it starts to spread.
Part of the light goes down, goes to the table, and we started to see these ripples.
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that's bouncing inside.
At that time, the waves travel through the table and because of the reflection of the top, you see at the bottom of the bottle, after several frames, that the thoughts are concentrated.
Now, if we take a common and current bullet, and we make it go the same distance and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much think it would lead us to sit at that movie?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film of a slide bullet.
And how about testing with dead nature?
You can see the waves that are coming out of the table, the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It's the way nature painting a picture, I thought, from a female at once, but, of course, our eyes see an integral composition.
But if you look at this shot, you'll realize that as the light is coming out of the tomato, it's still brilliant . It doesn't dark.
Why? Because the tomato is mature, and the light bounces in it, and it comes back after several billion seconds.
In the future, when this female is in its mobile phones, they can go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is mature without having to touch it.
What do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a low exposure, it comes into very little light.
But we'll get a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition, so I'll just come into some light.
So we sent that bullet, that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very tight synchronization, we took those gigabytes of data, and we interviewed them automatically to create those phenomena that showed them.
We can take all of that data in raw and process it in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
What if a new power of a Swedish future would allow him to see after corners?
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door . Respond, enter the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
It's where we could extract those multiple light bounces.
It's not science fiction . We've built it.
On the left, it's our temperature.
Behind the wall there is a machine and we'll bounce the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature Communism.
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works that fast, our feedback, it has unique capabilities.
It's very good temporary resolution, and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point corresponds to what distance.
When you project a laser, you can record a picture of a picture, which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, tens of images, put them together and try to analyze the multiple light bounces, and with that, can we see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
This is our reconstruction.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's around the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build conflicts that are able to see the inside of the body in the body, and the same for cardiacas.
But of course, because of tissue and blood, this is pretty difficult, so this is actually a and the scientists to begin to think about the feminist as a new model of visualization to solve the problems of images in health of the next generation.
Just like Doc English, he himself a scientist, became art science, an art of shared photographs.
And I realized that all of the gigabytes of data that we collected are not just for scientific visualization, but we can be able to be able to be.
I'll create a new form of computing photography with slow camera and color code.
And let's look at those waves . Remember, time between each of those waves is just a few hundred seconds.
But here's something fun.
If you look at the waves under the lid, these are away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects . Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The order of events in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
By applying the corresponding space of space and time, we can correct this distortion.
It's time . Thank you.
Hi . This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, it can photograph a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, upload it to University and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a 1984 boy, and I'm living in the city of Berlin.
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people tried to look for change.
This is the fall of 1989 . Imagine if all these people gathered in search of a change, they had a cell phone.
Who in the present have a cell phone here?
Get them up.
Raise your mobile phones, take them out!
Let them . An Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot . Almost everybody today has a cell phone.
But today, I'm talking about me, from my cell phone, and how life changed me.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35,000 lines of information.
It's gross data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the U.S. Commission presented a directive.
Data detection Director.
This directive says that every single European telephone company, every Internet provider, all of Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls who . Who sends an email to who.
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use the cell phone, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and until two years, in their phone company or their Internet provider.
And all of Europe, people stood up and said,``We don't want this . ''
They said they didn't want this data.
We want the self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone and the Internet providers to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said,``We don't want this . ''
And here you can see about 10 thousand people who came up to the streets of Berlin, and they said,``Freedom, not fear . ''
And some of you even said this would be the Stage 2.0.
The State was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the cell phone?
So I asked my phone, Derek Telegary, who at the time was the largest telephone company in Germany, who Please send me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I became asked, and I didn't get a concrete answer . It was all blah, blah.
But then I said,``I want to have this information because you're protecting my life . ''
So I decided to start a judicial demand because I wanted to have this information.
But Derek Tele-Actor said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end, we signed an agreement.
I would remove the demand and they would send me the information that I asked.
In the meantime, the German constitutional Germany failed institution for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly book on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Trip and five thousand lines of information.
At first I saw it and I said, well, it's a huge file . Okay.
But after a while I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little skeptical: what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to go out.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data retention means.
So, next to Keith Online and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a six months visualization of my life.
You can zoom up and go away, go back and forth.
You can see every step I give.
And you can see how I'm from Frank in train to colony, and what frequency I call in the journey.
All of this is possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife, and she calls me, we talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they're called between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this great network of communications.
You can see how people communicate each other to what time they call each other, what time sleep sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the group leaders.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to who, who gives you an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the 1980s fall, had a cell phone.
And the State had known who involved in this protest, and if the State had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The Berlin Wall in Berlin may never have happened.
And in a consequence, neither of the Korea Court.
Because today state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible inside and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to store them forever.
But self-determination and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a 21st century value, and it's not happening.
When you go home, tell your representation that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, you don't have to.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time they use their mobile phones to remember that they have to fight for self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call me Maxetton Zapa, and I'm not drunk, but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I cut my mom six times in six different directions, advising the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I I have cerebral palsy, so I'm just going to have a little bit of time.
Look.
It's exhausting . I'm like a mixture of Shakespeare.
And Muhammad Ali.
The P C. is not genetics.
It's not frozen and it can't contract.
No one curse the uterus of my mother and I didn't control because my parents were cousins, even though they are.
It just happens by accidents, like the one that happened to me at birth.
Now, I warn you, I'm not a source of inspiration.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they've wanted to be disabled.
Let's go out of it.
Christmas spreads, they're in the mall, they drive in circles in search for parking, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think,``God, can I be at least a little disabled? ''
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and P C. is just one of them.
There's a pipe of oppression, I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian, Muslim, woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should.
I'm from Park Climate, in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initiatives.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I could.
Many people with brain palsy don't walk, but my parents don't believe in the``can't . ''
The mantra of my father was,``You can be doing it; dancing song . ''
If my three major sisters cleaned, I cleaned.
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents gave up the school system, and they made sure that I was also, and if we didn't take all the maximum note, we all got my mother's shoes.
My father taught me to walk at five years old by putting my sticks on his feet and just walking.
Another tactics I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I would pursue it.
The strategy that I carried inside was very strong and ...
Yes . The first day in the kindergarten garden, I was walking like a bomb champion that has received a lot of hits.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and they were all of the family.
There are now 20 Arabs, and it's still all of the family . I think nobody realized that we were not Italian.
This was before 9/11 and that politicians would think of appropriate to use``hate Muslims"as a campaign.
The people who grew up didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to worry about a lot that died of starvation during the branch.
I told them that it had enough fat to live three months without eating, so to help the dawn of dawn, it's very easy.
I danced in Broadway.
Yes, in Broadway . It's crazy . My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I was sent to dance school.
I learned to dance with heels, or I can walk with heels.
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be a kid, so if my friends used heels, I also.
And when my friends were going to pass summer vacation on the coast of Jesus, I didn't go.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we didn't go back to Palestine every summer, we would become Madonna.
In summer vacation, often my father was trying to meet me, so I drank milk milk, they put hot cups on my back, I joined me in the Dead Sea, and I remember the water burned my eyes and I thought,``It works, it works! ''
But the miracle cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before doing yoga was a standard comedian that couldn't stand up.
And now I can hold my head.
My parents reinforced this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the General Hospital Telescope.
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a scholarship for the United States, University of the state of Arizona, because I entered all of the cars.
It was like the pet department pet.
Everybody loved me.
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the maximum note in my classes, and also in their classes.
Every time I made a scene of the crystal zoo, my teachers cried.
But I never get a paper.
Finally, in my last year, the United States decided to make a work called David very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with brain palsy.
I was a girl with cerebral palsy.
So I started screaming at four winds,``In the end, I'll have a role!
I have brain palsy!
The free line! In the end!
Thank God all-powerful God, I I, I . ''
I don't get the paper . They gave him to Mr. Brown.
I went to incorporate the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask why, and she told me that because they believed it couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said,``Excuse me, if I can't do the risk stunts, you can't get the character . ''
It was a role for which he literally had born and gave it to an actress without brain palsy.
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a high story of hearing actors without disability for disabled roles.
When I graduated, I went home, and my first active tour was as strange in a television.
My dream became reality.
And I knew that it would be advanced from``roommate"to``better buddy ,"in a sanctuary.
Instead, I was there as a vase, I didn't see me more than the stranger, and it was obvious to me that the reporter directors didn't hire random, white actors, with disability.
They only hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at Whole Goldberg, Rose Barry, Ellen, and all these women had one thing in common: they were comedians.
That's why I became funny.
In my first tour, I took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first cartoon that I took when I realized that I was going at high speed by the New Jersey freeway with a driver that had brain palsy.
I worked in clubs around the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first monopoly in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I do know that you never heard that little nasty rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean Obama, and I launched the New York City Festival, now in his 10 years.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the Arabs in the media, and at the same time remind them to the reports of the report that social and Arabic are not synonymous.
International Arabs was much easier than fighting the challenge of the disability of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited the cable news program behind Keith Olympic.
I walked into a graduate dance, I got dragged into a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said,``Excuse me, can you give me another chair? ''
She looked at me and said,``Five, four, three, two...''
And we were in live!
So I went back to the desk desk to not get out of the screen during the segments, and when I finished the interview, I was pale.
At the end, I had my opportunity, and I took it off . I knew they wouldn't invite me.
But not only Mr. Olympic came back to me, but I was a full-time participant and I pasted my chair.
One fun thing that I learned in direct with Keith Sulare was that people on the Internet are high school.
It's said that kids are cruel, but they never got rid of me nor a little girl.
Suddenly, my Internet disability became object.
I see online clips with comments like,``Why is it worth? ''
\" Is it stop? ''
And my favorite,``Poor terrorist . ''
What does it have?
We really should pray for it . ''
A committee suggested even to add my disability to my rsum: guilty, comedian, paralyzed.
disability is as visual as race.
If someone in wheelchair can't make Beijing, then Beijing can't make someone in wheelchair.
The disabled are the -- yes, clapping, man . Come on.
The disabled are the largest minority in the world, and the most super-sort minority in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said I won't walk, but I'm here before you.
However, I grew up with the media, I don't think I was.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children well.
My turtle journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to walk through the red carpet that was locked by the split of the Susan Lucy Telescopes and the Cleverland Arts.
I got to act in a film with Adam Saled and work with my pain, incredible Dave Matthews.
I run the world down,``The Arabs have become crazy . ''
I was delegation of the great state of New Jersey in the 2008 DNA.
And I founded``The Children in May ,"a charities to give kids Palestinian refugee kids a little bit of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me live, and I devote this talk to his memory.
Discover in peace, dad.
I call me Mayan Zapa, and if I can, you can also.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know her story.
It lives in a small town to South Somalia.
This town is near Mahatma.
drought drives the little village to poverty and on the edge of the institution.
Without anything for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, Mahatma, the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there is no work, no future perspective.
He ended up in a tent in the city to the outskirts of Mogadishu.
And after maybe a year, I had nothing.
One day he's about a gentleman that offers him to take her to lunch, after dinner, to breakfast.
It knows a dynamic group of people who give it a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home, his family.
You present a young man.
It's finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in Mogadishu, under a blue sky, a car bomb.
That child of that little town with dreams of the big quality was the suicide bomber, and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So, how do the story of a little town in a small village try to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him by inventing?
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came.
This was the first thing that came out of what we call the``waiting period . ''
And his story repeats in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the outcasts, young unemployed urban people who trigger riots in Johannesburg, who are descending riots in London, looking for something beyond the``waiting period . ''
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, of well-being, but young people are not participating in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffers from the highest rate of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities will be under 18.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities, the history of the waiting period, the access door to terrorism, to violence, to gangs, to be the history of the 2.0 cities.
And in my hometown, Maxopt , 70 percent of young people are unemployed.
70 percent don't work, don't go to school.
They don't do virtually anything.
I went back to Mogadishu last month, and I went to visit the Middle Hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember to be in that hospital lying in the bullets thinking,``If I'd never gone? ''
What if I had seen me forced to be in that same``period of waiting . ''
Would I have become terrorists?
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in Mogadishu that month was actually to harbor a juvenile leader in a business.
It's about 90 Somali juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was Adam.
He went to the University of Mogadishu, graduated.
I had no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he told me, that because it was a graduate, unemployed college, frustrated, was the perfect white for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.
They looked for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In Mogadishu, the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B is the streets.
Venter years of civil war have completely destroyed the viable system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to mobilize.
Adam saw an opportunity and leverage it.
It started a motorcycle company.
It started alligatory motorizes to local residents who couldn't normally buy them.
I bought 10 engines, with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of engines over the next three years.
Why is this story different?
What does it do to this different story?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I I think business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the``waiting period . ''
It makes young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so desperately.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Muhammad Momontle, a flower.
I was helping to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of corporate initiative.
In fact, it's the first flower that Maddish has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers to your wedding, you were using plastic, you're sent from the foreign.
If you asked someone,``When was the last time you saw fresh flowers? ''
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be,``Never . ''
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a formal skydiving company.
I created a farm on the outskirts of Mogadishu, and he started growing the climbers and maggots, who said, could survive the hard weather of Mogadishu.
And it started the delivery of flowers for weddings, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in Mogadishu in 22 years.
There are no public parks in Mogadishu.
It wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and, like he says, smell the proverbial pink.
By the way, he doesn't grow rocks because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, Mohamed's presence had a really profound impact in young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their story, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
I forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be an artist of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They tried business solutions for local problems.
So, inspired young people and creating a business of corporate spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas.
They need experience and guidance to guide them in the development and post their business.
They connect young people with the resources they need, balance them the support they need to go from conception to creation, and create catalyst for urban growth.
For me, corporate spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park Park, this is how he calls it, when he's created, to transform the way people see their city.
They're able to hire the street kids to help rent and maintain the motors for him.
I gave them a chance to escape from the paralysis of the waiting period.
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is: convert young people in entrepreneurs, incentives and feed their inherent innovation, and you'll have more stories about flowers and parks of peace that you're willing and waiting periods.
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to camping with my dad at the Adam Mountains, an area in the north of the New York state.
It was a beautiful day.
The frozen forest.
The sun made the leaves shine as a virtual, and not to be the way that we followed, we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to get that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a cover in a risk with a beautiful crystal lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the coverage there was a garbage, about four square meters with apple hearts, pound paper balls, and old piece of paper.
And I was angry, I was very angry and incredibly confused.
The kites that were too lazy to take what they had brought, who thought he was going to clean their trash?
That question followed with me, and it's just a little simplified.
Who clean our trash?
No matter how or where you put the``ours ,"who clean our trash in Istanbul?
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or London?
Here in New York, the Department of healthcare clean our trash, at reason from 11,000 tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that burden?
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their tracks and interviewed people in offices and installations in the entire city, and I learned a, but it was still an intruder.
I needed to go more.
So I began to work as a garbage collector.
Now I didn't just travel in trucks . I drove them.
And it operated the mechanical stunts and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asks about smell.
It's there, but it's not as predictable as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong, you're rapidly used.
It costs a lot to engage the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept taking on the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage every week.
There's also danger.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the waste collection is one of the ten most dangerous occupation in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day, and you go around you.
They just want to happen, so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless thing.
When you get out of the cradle and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a nature's force itself.
It never stopped coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It's always going to be moving.
And there's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think that the waste collectors are the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
It's the first public health protectors.
If you don't get rid of the waste in efficient and effective waste every day, this starts to get rid of your containers and your inherent dangers threaten us in very real ways.
Disease we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and start to give us.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old, we don't have space for what the motors of the economy begin to fail when consumption is endangered.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing its relationship.
And then it's what I call our average daily speed.
And I'm just talking about the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't worry, we don't repair, clean or take our coffee cup, our bag bag, our water bottle.
We use them, we throw them, we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that will be taken off.
So today, I want to suggest a couple ways of thinking about waste collection that maybe help reduce stigma and include them in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His job, I, is almost cathartic.
They're on the street every day, rhythmic.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you expect them.
And their work allows us to make our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us away from ourselves, of our own waste, our waste, and that flow has always been to stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11th , 2001, I heard the grade of a collection truck of waste on the street, grab my little son and lowered the stairs running, and there was a man doing his paper recycling journey as he did all the Wednesday.
And I tried to thank him to do his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and he just nodded, and he said,``We're going to be right.
We're going to be fine . ''
Shortly after that, I started researching the waste collection and I went back to that man.
It's called Paul, we worked together many times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that Paul was right.
We're going to be right.
But in our efforts to regulate the way we exist on this planet as a species, we need to include all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor.
The municipal waste, what we think when we talk about garbage, represent three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next you see someone whose work is to clean the trash of you, take a moment to recognize them.
Take a moment to say thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a commercial center of several floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa.
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was,``I want to get out . ''
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to highlight.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very big stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the crisis is generating heat in the inside, so you need a lot of cooling.
In a city where this shouldn't happen, because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And third, it looks nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame trying to be so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really carefully charged with the old market that is this open-air structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small marketers.
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a modern building, from several floors, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented by the site, which is located in a area of much growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, bringing all the inputs in the building.
And this is extended with an inclined atrium that creates an air space in the building that is authorized, by its own form, the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with little businesses, which changes in every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how do you close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would respond to local climate conditions.
And I put myself to think about a similar tissue to an ant shell to allow the air input, and also the light, but in a filter way.
Then we inspired ourselves in these beautiful buttons of the events of the Ethiopian.
They have the properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the facade.
We're building that with these little predatory pieces that are the windows that let the air pass and light in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is comprised with these little colored crystals that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas, it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought,``That's not a mall . It wasn't what we asked . ''
But in fact, we all realized that this idea of the market turned out to be much more profitable than the mall, because ultimately there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic, not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because it was no longer necessary air.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy self-assembly for the building in a city where electricity gets cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage putting photographs on the roof.
And then under those panels, we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of gathering and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these portes on the roof, which is in the roof, collect water for the indoor health.
It's expected for the early year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in Tunisia City.
And to make a project so big, the biggest one I've designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the middle, a 1,000 years of ancient years that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access doors connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was to expand the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities from Europe with these courtyards.
In addition to that, we selected some strategic points in relationship with the idea of interconnected doors with straight lines, and this modified the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell of the project, like apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the Mediterranean climate?
And it's North, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we have a scheme that makes sure that most apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with patients, and then in the lower plant we have all the connections for pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a greater density on top levels and a lower density in the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project, is almost like catching the community the space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can climb up and socialize, and make activities such as running a two kilometers per mile in the morning, or jumping from one building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at the architecture looking for simple but affordable solutions that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl came to our class . It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had big amounts of hair that was very bright, and a small stripe of pencils, cute . It was super strong for the states of states, very good for surgery.
I ended up that year, and I was full of jealousy, until I brought my sinister plan.
I had a day after the school out of school . I was a little late and hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was dropped, it came out, in the classroom, I took from my teacher's table, the book of ratings.
And then I did.
I'm going to alter the ratings of my rival, just a little, just some like this.
All of the same . And I got up to turn the book into the crate, but, to see, some of my other colleagues had very good grades as well.
So in a frenzy, I ran the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of the lines of G and myself a line of this, just to be there, because I could ...
I still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came.
I don't understand why I felt good doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never caught me.
It was all deliberately obvious.
I never discovered.
But above all, I'm getting rid of the reason why I was bothered that this little girl, so small, was so good for virtue.
I was intrigued by jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so powerful.
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
The primates . The blue birds are very prosthetic.
We know that the cells are the number one cause of climate killings in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that looked at loneliness, or long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab in which cells are studied in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no Helvet, no``Odyssey . ''
There would be no king, no``The One and one night . ''
There would be no Shakespeare.
They would disappear the high school reading lists, because we would be losing``The Noise and the Force ,"there would be no``Gates"and``Peace . ''
Without cells, there's no Proust . I know that I is in a fashion saying that Proust has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, almost it's all.
This year is 100 years of his masterpiece,``In the lost time ,"the most exhausted study of sexual cells and also the ordinary competitiveness, mine, everything we could have . And thinking in Proust, we have the sentimental details, right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a manufacturer manifestation in you.
We forget how hard that image is.
We forget how complicated it is.
That is, it's about books that Virginia Wolfe said were as hard as a cat chip.
I don't know what the cat trick is, but we assume it's super.
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the jealousy, the cells and Product.
Is it going to be very obvious as the cells, who reduce the person, their wish, to their implications, are a very solid narrative base?
I don't know . I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel cells, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being at the same time and audience, we know exactly what details will include, to clarify the knife, right?
The cells make us all amateur novels, and that's something that Proust understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give another one, maybe right now . ''
And it starts to tell himself that story, and since then, Proust says that every cool love that Disney detects in his lover, he adds him to his collection of torture instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that symphony and Proust, they were notoriously jealous.
You know, the Proud boyfriend would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with him.
But you don't have to be so nice to recognize it's a hard job . Right?
The cells are exhausting.
It's a hungry emotion . You have to feed it.
And what are the cells?
The cells are suffering from information.
The cells use the details.
The cells like the big quantities of bright hair and the cute and small stripe of pencils.
The cells get from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful . Proust line well the language of the language with the cells.
When Swaptree is in his ice agony, suddenly listening to the doors and bribe to the servants of his lover, then they defend those behaviors.
He says,``Look, I know that this is reproductive, but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a memorial . ''
He says,``They're scientific research with real intellectual value . ''
And I'm trying to prove that the cells look at it, and they make us seem absurd, but in their meme, they're search for knowledge, search for truth, a painful truth . In fact, what I to Proust awareness, the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the humiliation, the loss: These were the pathways to the wisdom of Proust.
He says,``A woman who needs, that makes us suffer, causes us a range of much deeper and vital feelings than a wise man who can interest us . ''
Is it telling us that we're going to look for cruel women?
No . I think it's trying to say that the cells revealed ourselves.
And is there any other emotion that makes us open up this particular way?
Is there any other emotion revealed by our agency, our horrible ambition and our rights?
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at that peculiar intensity?
Freud would write about it later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very intricate young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife was fooled.
And Freud says there was something weird in that man, who didn't look at what his wife did.
Because she was innocent; everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he looked for things that he did his wife, without realizing, involuntary behaviors.
Do you smile too much? Or does it accidentally laugh with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the habit of his wife's unconscious.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how the cells make us look intense but unprecedented.
In fact, the more intensely jealous we are, the more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I I, , the cells lead us to make violent or illegal acts.
The cells drive us to behave in completely unimaginable ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight, I recognize it, but I'm also thinking about this story I heard in the news.
A woman in Michael of 52 years old was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from the one that was sent up with life, horrible messages for a year.
For a year . It's a year.
She was trying to instill the new girlfriend of her boyfriend . I have to confess that when or this, they react with admiration.
Because we're realistic.
What huge, even unfortunately, creativity . Right?
It's like novel.
It's like a New Heirdography novel.
Heighough is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character from American literature.
It's the author of``strangers in a train"and``The talented Mr. Republic ,"books that try to how cells, confuse our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in the realm of the jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be punched in an instant.
Take Tom Ridley, your most famous character.
Tom Ridley is going to want to or want what you have to get away from your self and to pass what you ever had, and it's under the floor . It responds to your name, you take your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the Tom Republic route.
I can't give you all the world, as much as I sometimes wanted.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social networks, where the currency is envy? Right?
The novels show us the output? I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what characters always do when they're not safe, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to 27 of Baker Street, and we asked him by Sherter Holmes.
When people think about Hollywood, they think about the curse of the curse in Professor Moriarty, that criminal genius.
But I've always been preferred [to] the insect, the head face of Scott Yak that needs Hollywood desperately, needs the Georgetown genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so familiar.
Leader needs its help, but the Reserve, and bureaucratic, with bitterness in each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in``The Sixth Nations adventure ,"once Holehos went into, he slept all with his solution, Reader comes back to Hollands and says,``We're not jealous, Mr. Holes.
We are proud of you . ''
And he says there's no person at Scott Yard who didn't want to shake her hand.
It's one of the few times that we see Hollands translated in history . I think this really emotional . That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the cells as a geometry problem, without emotion.
You know, in a minute Holmes is from the opposite side of Lean.
The next minute are the same side.
Suddenly, Lead is allowed to admire that idea of being the answer.
Could it still be so simple?
What if the cells are really a geometry issue, just a question of where we are in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to feel the excellence of the other.
We can align with it.
But I like container plans.
So as we expect that to happen, we remember we have the fiction to comfort us.
Only the fiction of the cells.
The fiction alone, I invite you to the table.
And look at what addicts: the Learth Slug, the terrifying Tom Republican, the Swiss crazy, the Missis Promote.
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 , 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the plant of Apollo 11 and discovered on the Taliban Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the modern surface gray was the culmination of a conventional collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest mobility in peace times in the history of America.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including the Apollo 1 crew.
But before the Apollo Apollo program , 24 men traveled to the moon.
Doctor walked on their surface, which Albert after the death of Armstrong, last year, is now the oldest.
So why were they?
They didn't bring a way back : 38 pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 will affect later, a new sense of the small and fragility of our common home.
Why were it? The cynical answer is because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets, that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in 1962 give us a better idea.
John F. Kennedy: Some questions, why do the moon?
Why do you turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why do you scale the highest mountain?
35 years ago, why fly on the Atlantic?
Why play Rice against Texas?
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason Pogue: For the contemporaries, the Apollo wasn't just a West victory on the East War.
At the time, the strongest emotion was to wonder to the transcendence of the power of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to do.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological triumph.
The first half of the 20th century produced the line of assembly and plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, polio was eradicated, and the smallpox was eliminated.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin Topology is in 1970 called``accelerating force . ''
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship ship, but in 1969, the Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles a hour.
Since 1970, no human being has come back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo 10, and the optimistic joy on the power of technology has been evaporated by seeing that problems that we imagine technology will solve how to go to Mars, create clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to be intractable results.
I remember watching Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me you don't look at the short scale of the Saturday V.
I knew vividly that this would be the last woman mission, but I was completely sure that I would come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that said,``Something happened to our ability to solve problems with technology ,"has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have distract us and have been locked up with trivial toys, things like iPhone, apps and social networks, or algorithms that accelerate the automated sale.
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a Darwinian explanation in Silicon Valley, who trust that they have created less ambitious companies than those of the years that Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Georgia.
Silicon Valley says that markets are guilty, in concrete, the incentives that risk capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused you to change the creation of transformative ideas for financial problems, or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It explains mostly what's wrong in Silicon Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their peak without worrying at risk, they preferred small investments, tiny investments that they could go out in 10 years.
The CDs . They've always had problems to invest with benefits in technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is long-term capital . They haven't invested in developing technology development to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we wanted.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar, wind and biomass -- less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind energy, and oil is cheaper than biomass.
We want alternative energy sources that can compete prices . They don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties will incentivize the development of an alternative energy, mostly, a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the coal price.
But there is no hope in the political climate today that we'll see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for the time that famines are the result of failure in the food report.
But 30 years of research have taught us that females are political crises that affect food distribution.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and food repair, but there will be hungry while there are bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes fold a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
President Nixon will declare the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant ones to treatment, and only in the last 10 years seem to be found effective and viable treatments.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we cannot solve problems with technology.
We can and have, but these four elements have been present: political leaders and population should want to solve the problem; institutions should support the solution; it should be really about a technological problem, and we should understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, fulfilled with those criteria.
But it's a reputational model in the future.
We're not in 1961.
There is no galaxy competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who's a high school and the dangerous, and there is no a popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was only three days.
And really, it wasn't even solving any problem.
We are alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't lack the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by reading you the general ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they have become clicks of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a recipe: there's been a big decline of trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a task: we should recover trust.
I think the recipe, the goal and the task have been interpreted.
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a reconciliation, a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all: why do people think that trust has declined?
And if I think about the base of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I love to think that it may have declined in some activities or institutions, and it could have increased in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can go back to the opinion surveys, and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of belief that trust has declined.
When you look at the opinion surveys over time, there are no many evidence of it.
That is, people who were described 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still inspired the same mistrust.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite reliable: judges, nurses.
The rest is in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen on the street is almost exactly halfway.
But is this evidence enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, are opinions.
What else can you record?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people manifest when they ask certain questions.
Do politicians? Trust on teachers?
Now, if someone asked you,``Do you trust the vegetables?
The fishermen?
Do you trust the primary teachers? ''
You probably start to ask,``What? ''
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question,``Well, I trust some, but in others not . ''
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deploy trust differently.
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel by a certain kind of officer, functional or kind of person, is going to be uniform in every case.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain primary teacher that I know to give the reading class, but no way to drive the school microbes.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good driver.
I could trust my most local friend to keep a conversation, but not, maybe, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've gotten those evidence in our everyday lives of the way that trust is different, why do we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more abstract way?
I think that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to live the good judgment in the fact that they trust something or someone.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that goal I would pursue.
I would argue to have more trust in what it is, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a part of not trusting what is not reliable.
And I think those people who put their savings with the very clearly called Mr. Madoff, which then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too confident.
Having more trust is not an intelligent goal in this life.
It's confident or denied confidence, that's the right goal.
Once you say it, it says, yes, it's worth, it means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is doing a judgment of how reliable people are in certain aspects.
And I think to be able to do a judgment, we're forced to focus on three things.
Are they competitive? Are they honest? Are they responsible?
And if we find that a person is competitive in the relevant materials, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a good reason to trust it, because it's going to be trust.
But if, in contrast, they're not responsible, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but I wouldn't trust them to take a letter to the email, because they're forgotten.
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they overestimate their own competence.
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are competent and responsible but extremely dishonest.
If it's so, I haven't been asked yet.
But that's what we're looking for: trustworthiness before you trust.
The trust is the answer.
trustworthiness is what we have to judge.
And, of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so on, that they made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as they should.
I remember once I was talking to a party, and he said,``Well, you'll see, the problem is that it takes more time to do the administrative paper that will attend the part itself . ''
And we find the same problem in all of our public life, and institutional, that the accountability system that's destined to ensure trustworthiness and testing testing, actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is we can tell the work of people who have to make difficult tasks, like the parts, to tell you that``mark the boxes ,"as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
All of that, for the goal.
I think the goal should be more trustworthiness, and that things would be different if we try to be a trust of trust, and we will transmit the people that we are trustworthy, and if we try to determine whether other people, functional or political people are trust.
It's not easy . It's judgment, simple actions, attitudes, what doesn't do properly.
Third, task.
It's going to call the task to rebuild trust, put things upside up.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit about trustworthiness.
We can do it if it's two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, in definition, is distinctive because we're awarded by other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them the enough bases so they can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't cheat, usually, all people, all the time.
But you've also got to be able to get some happy evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That's done every day, everywhere, the common people, the officials, the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can give you without giving explanation.
I take them and give me the money, or I'm changing them for the color I want.
That's great . I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other part, that's a good proof that you are worthy of trust, and you have trust in what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think that what we're pointing on is not a very difficult thing to get away.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is trust.
Thank you.
From the beginnings of computers, we've come to strive for reducing separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be broken.
This separation has been reducing, increasingly and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I wonder, and if there were no barriers?
I started imagining what it would be.
I first created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the strong open against the screen, it's its physical body to pixels.
Designers can kill their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So, with this tool, the barriers broke.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the hands of your hands?
At the division of Microsoft Science Science, along with my mentor Captain Bonobo, he redesigned the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area.
It's combining a transparent visit with depth cameras to detect fingers and face, now you can raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space, to select them is as easy as taking a book from a shelf.
You can shake the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that's below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we put into the digital world.
What if we invest the papers and make digital information come to us?
Sure, many of us have bought, and I returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I've got here is a virtual Internet worker.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted in your head or translucent when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, rather than just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical so that we can touch them and feel them?
What would a future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator Removai Post, we created this only physical pixel.
This spherical magnet is behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer and the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
Simple, what we did was we would harness gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation, mechanical action and detectors.
And by the way we digitally program the object, we release it from time constraints and space, which means that human movements can be recorded and back to reproduce and stay forever in the physical world.
You can teach photos physically and at distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can reproduce as a physical reality, the times we wanted.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the planets of planets, physics, and unlike monitors or text books, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel . It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to get rid of our world.
We started talking about a barrier, but if we suppress that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become a gym for two years in Hungary, China, in the '70s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer to a school for athletes with all payment costs.
But my tiger mother said,``No . ''
My parents wanted me to become an engineer, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed that there was only a certain path towards happiness: a safe and good job.
No matter whether the job would love or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese singer singer.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
A opera singer should start training from very young to learn the assets, so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of school and a radio program.
But no adults would love the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends supported me, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at age 15, I knew it was too much too much more to train.
My dream would never be done.
It feared, that during the rest of my life, a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another vocation.
Nobody around me wanted to teach me? Okay.
It turns out the books.
[" You're Complex ."] [`` Lesions . ''
Those who were banned in China, of course.
\" The Good Earth"is about Chinese company life.
And it's not a convenient propaganda . I understand.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a revelation:``Honor your father and your mother . ''
\" honor ,"I said,``It's so different, and much better than obey . ''
So it became my tool to come out of this confused guilt trap and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my shared reading habit.
It's a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me out of place because this is what the students in China learned.
I was never going on, China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
Company reading is not a new thing.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's to research camps as comparative religion and comparative literature.
Compared and contrast, offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if comparative reading worked to investigate, why not do it also in everyday life?
So I started reading books from two.
You can try with people [`` Benjamin Franklin"by Walter Islamic] [`` John Adams"by David McCar -- that they were involved in a same rise, or friends with shared experiences.
For the Christ, the temptation is economic, political and spiritual.
For the Buddha, they're all psychological, lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
[" The Walk of China Tue"Thomas Mars) [`` The walk of the Great"Alan Watson -- instead of losing in the translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that``happiness"in Chinese literally means``fast joy ."Ha!
And``girlfriend"in Chinese literally means``new mother . ''
The books opened me a magical door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know that won't feel alone or powerless never.
Having a destroyed dream is really not compared to what many others have suffered.
I've come to believe that reality is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that dreams come from, where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Even a destroyed dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to books, which today I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always accompanied them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first client of psychotherapy.
I was a Ph.D. student in a medical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
Alex came into the first session using jeans and a hotel plate, threw on the couch of my office, and he told me that he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so relieved.
My classmates had a profile as a first client.
And I took a fan that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the joke stories that Alex brought to the sessions, he made me easy just to move his head while we were delayed the solution.
\" Trips are the new windows ,"Alex said, and so I saw, she was right.
You start working later, it's home later, you have kids later, to death happens later.
For sentences like Alex, and I had time.
But shortly after, my supervisor pushed me to press Alex to talk about his loving life.
I was resistant.
I said,``Of course, it's coming out with guys under your category, you hit a head, but it's not like you're going to marry with him . ''
And then my supervisor said,``Not yet, but maybe it's married with the next.
In addition, the best moment to work in Alex's marriage is before it gets married . ''
This is what psychologists call a``Aha!"moment.
It was when I realized that the 30 is not the new 20.
Yes, people feel head after what they were used, but this didn't make the 20th of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the 20th of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were wasting it.
So I realized, that this kind of benign recklessness was a real problem, and it had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of veterinarians everywhere.
There are 50 million volunteers in the United States today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider no one gets to adulthood without going on before the 20th.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20s.
I want to see the slides here.
Oh, yeah! They're incredible.
If you work with slaves, you love a fan, you remove the dream of a slave, I want to see . It's okay . Amazing, the real sandwiches matter.
This is not just my opinion . These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at age 35.
This means that eight out of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments``Aha!"shapes his life will have happened to when they have 30 and so many.
People from over 40, don't get panic.
This audience is going to be okay, I I.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact about how many money they will win.
We know that more than half Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at the age of 30.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final growth stage in its 20s and reproductive for adulthood, which means that if there's something you want to change yourself, now it's time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times for its 20 than at any time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to its hotel at 28, and things become complicated at 35.
The 20th are the moment to educate on their body and their options.
When we think about child development, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily and common life has an impact in the person that will become.
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our 20 are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the veterinarians are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the timeline time.
Researchers call 20 an extended adolescence.
journalists are telling you ridiculous names as``telescopes"and``boats . ''
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a trivial what actually is the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonardo Bernstein said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think it happens when you give a slow on your head and say,``You have another 10 years to start your life? ''
It's not happening.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely anything.
And then every day, smart fans, interesting, interesting like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this:``I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count . I'm just killing time . ''
Or they say,``Everybody says that as it starts a race before the 30, everything will be fine . ''
But then it starts to sound like this:``My 20 are at closing, and I still have nothing to show.
I had better rsum the day I graduated from college . ''
And then it starts to sound like this:``My dating for the 20th were like the chair of the chairs.
They all run and they were fun, but then at some point around the 30, the music came out and everybody began to sit.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay stop, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I was 30 . ''
Where are the windows here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but it's not wrong, the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the '30s, there's a huge pressure to the traffic and so many to start a career, choose a city, choose a couple, and have two or three children in a much shorter time period.
Many of these things are not compatible, and there are research that start to show, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything at the age of 30.
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many of them, and so many of them look themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their 20s,``What was I doing? What was I thinking? ''
I want to change what the windows are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it could be.
It's a story about a woman called Emma.
At the age of 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having a crisis of identity.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but he couldn't yet decide, so I spent the last few years working as a waiter.
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend who showed more temperaments than ambition.
And despite living about 20 very difficult, his previous life had been even harder.
He was often crying in our sessions, but then she lifted himself by saying,``You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends . ''
Well, one day Emma came up with his head on his legs and tears for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new conductor for a director, and I had spent every morning light it up with his many contacts, but then he looked at the empty space that followed after the words,``In case of emergency, please call me...''
I was at the point of the story when he saw me and said,``Who's going to be for me if I have a car accident?
Who's going to take care of me if I give cancer? ''
At that time, I got a lot of work to resist and not say,``Aye . ''
What Emma needed was not a therapist that really worried.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex to just sit down while Emma's decisive decade went ahead.
So, over the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all window, man or woman, deserves to know.
First, I told Emma that it would forget of that identity crisis and get capital of identity.
By capital capital, I mean doing something that adds value to your person.
Do something that is an investment in what they want to be after.
I didn't know the future of Emma's career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, of that boarding, of that company that they want to test.
I'm not getting rid of the dry exploration, I'm descending the exploration that I shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration.
It's practical.
I told Emma that I would explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are overrated.
The best friends are great to take us into the airport, but the veterinarians that come together with similar minds are limited in terms of who they know, what they know, how they think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who's going to leave almost always comes from out of their closest circle.
The new things come from what's called weak friends friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the fans have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half is not, and the weak ties are the way we're going to collapse this group.
Half of the working work is never published, then, knowing the boss of your neighbor is the way you get a job of not published.
It's not cheating . It's the science of how information happens.
And last but not less, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing, but as a fan, Emma soon to pick up his family, when he has a couple and form his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think 30 is better age to sit in head than the 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live with now or you're getting up now when everyone in Facebook starts walking towards the altar is not progress.
The best moment to work in your marriage is before you have it, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
choosing your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just making it work or kill time with anyone that hits you.
So what happened with Emma?
Well, we looked at that director, and she found the roommate of a cousin who worked on an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That work offer gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with which he lived.
Now, five years later, it's special organizing events in museums.
This married with a man who was consciously elected.
He love his new career, love his new family, and he sent me a letter, which said,``Now the emergency contact spaces are not big enough . ''
Emma's history can sound easy, but that's what I love working with windows.
It's very easy to help them.
The slaves are like airplanes that come out from the Los Angeles airport, who come out somewhere in the west.
Just before the takeoff, a slight line in its trajectory makes a difference between landing in Alaska or in Fiji.
In the same way, at the age of 21 or 25, and even 29, a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next years or even the next generations.
Here's my idea of spreading all the winners you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I have the privilege now to tell you to sentence as Emma every day: The tragedies are not the new 20, they pick up their adulthood, they get identity capital, they use their weak ties, they choose your family.
They don't let it define for what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very picky job in management consultant for a work that was even more demanding: dinner.
I went to teach them mathematics to seventh degrees in public schools in New York City.
And as any teacher, I applied exams and testing.
I give you homework.
When the job came back, he calculated the ratings.
What called me the attention was the CIA . It wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of them who had a better performance didn't have I.Q . paintings.
Some of my smartest kids weren't going so good.
And that got me thinking.
The kinds of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, secure, are difficult: proportions, decisions, the area of a paradigm.
But these concepts are not impossible, and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over enough.
After several years, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivation perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know is how to measure more.
It's C, but what if having success in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn differently and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a psychologist.
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of challenging scenarios, and in every study, my question was, who's successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the military West Point.
We tried to predict what cities would remain in military training and who would retreat.
We went to the National Department of Design, and we tried to predict what children would move the best possible in the competition.
We study novel teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, wondering what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and those, who will be the most effective to improve the results of their students' learning?
We associate with private companies, asking, which of these marketers are going to keep their jobs?
And who's going to make more money?
In all of those very different contexts, a feature arose as a major prediction of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good appearance, the physical health, and it wasn't the CIA.
It was determination.
The determination is passion and perseverance to reach very long-term goals.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is to cling to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it's a marathon, not a race at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my determination questionnaire and then wait for more than a year to see who they were recording.
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater chance of graduate, even when they were involved in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of standardized testing, even the security that kids felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National House of Design in which the determination matters . It's also in school, especially for children at risk of abandon.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little it knows about the science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me,``How do you develop determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid job solid?
How do you keep them motivated for the long term? ''
The most honest answer is, I don't know . What I know is that talent doesn't give you determination.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that are simply not following with their commitments.
In fact, in our data, determination is commonly not related or is even related to talent measures.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing determination in children is something called``growth mindset . ''
This is a developed idea at the University of Stanford by Carol Doctor, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. Dick has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to perceive when they fail, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop determination.
But we need more.
And that's where I end my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have ahead of.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions, and we need to test them.
We need to measure if they've been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start all again with the lessons learned.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more determined.
Thank you.
Growing in Taiwan as a daughter's daughter, one of my most scary memories is my mother showing beauty, shape and shape of Chinese characters.
So since that moment, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for an foreigners, it seems as impressive as the Grand Wall China.
In the last few years, I I've been wondering if I can leave this wall, so that whatever you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language, you can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and quick method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the pieces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic would understand 20,000 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 people will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signal signals, restaurant menus, understand the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today, I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
They open their mouth as much as possible until it's square.
Get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
People.
If the fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I was screaming in a front way,``Audience! I'm burning!"This symbol is actually original of the form of the call, but I like to believe it's the other way . The one that works.
This is a tree.
It trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees tree trees.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of doors in the old west.
I call these eight characters to these eight characters.
They're building blocks to create many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's``follow . ''
As the ancient said, two are company, three are crowd.
If one person will be their arms, this person is saying,``It was that big . ''
The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.
It's a prisoner, as Jonas inside the whale.
A tree is a tree . Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a``idiot ."Easy to remember, because a paralyzed tree is pretty idealistic.
Remember the fire?
Two fire together, it makes it very hot.
Three fire together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's burning.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two people together, prosperous.
Three together, those are flashes.
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the brightness.
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out about the horizon . Let me go.
A door . Put a table inside the door, it's the pig's brain.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
Did you take someone at home?
This person is coming out of a door, escape, evaluating.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're discussing.
Three women together, they have care is adult.
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radiologists will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing as an eight-year-old Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire . It's a volcano.
We know that Japan is the Earth's land.
This is a sun placed with the origin, because Japan is east in China.
So a sun next to the origin, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains piled on one another.
In ancient China, that meant exile, because Chinese employers destroyed their political enemies beyond mountains.
Today, exile has become coming out.
A mouth that tells you where to come out is a room.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage . Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies I get to see.
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids -- when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Wizard of Oz together.
The movie dominated its imagination for months.
His favorite character was Global, of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
Now we live and we raised our children in a kind of industrial complex show.
However, the Wizard of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took a fourth years later with, interestingly, another film whose protagonists, a metal guy, and a Palestinian guy rescued a dressed girl as an enemy guard.
Do you know what I'm talking about? Yes.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big differences between the Wizard of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the Wizard of Oz.
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like apples.
But I think that if the Wizard of Oz, the magician would say,``Dorothy, you're the Olympic salvation as the prophecy predicted it . ''
You use magical shoes to defeat the army generated by a computer of evil gross.
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing from the Wizard of Oz is that the most heroic, wise, even villages are women.
I started noticing this when I made Star Wars to my daughter a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
It's three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of survival had gone down . So, he woke up in the room and he was impressed as a mom leg with her patients behind, and I don't think he would understand what happened, but unfortunately, he absorbs everything.
I wonder what I perceive.
Would you be and particular issues, perseverance and loyalty?
Would you have the feeling that Luke is an army to defeat the government?
Let's compare this with the 1939 magician of 1939.
How do Dorothy win your film?
And making good guys with all and being a leadership.
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow, OK, and not a world of men fighting, which is where we are.
Why is there so much capital F, force in the movies for our children, and so little about the yellow brick?
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies in girls, and they should read it . It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
And I know by experience that the president Lewis doesn't provide the right framework that I was served to navigate the world of adults that is blended . I I think at the moment of the first kiss, I really expected the credit to start to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search has finished, I have girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do . ''
movies are focused on melting the villain and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other adventures.
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a warrior.
There are many exceptions, and to defend Disney's princess before any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, the kids, are not really their objective public.
They do a phenomenal job when they teach girls how to defend the patriarchy, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the patriarchy.
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women writing new stories for our children, as real and lovely like Hebron and Katringendand, but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful topic of all time continues to appear in classic after classical after a child's adventures or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who would believe a girl.
Until, as many of you are thinking, this year, I finally came out.
I recommend you all . It's available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when courageous came out?
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a princess.
It's very good . Don't let that stop them!
Well, almost none of these films is the proof of Beijing.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still no roots, and it's already spread, but maybe today we start a movement.
Alice Beijing is a comic comic, and in the mid-'70s, I recorded a conversation I had had with a friend of the evaluation of the movies that they saw.
And it's very simple . There are only three questions that you have to do: In the movie, there's more than a female character who has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the requirement.
Do these women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Your conversations are about something else besides the guy you like so much? Okay? Thank you . Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
It happens . I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie, OK.
Right? Russime ruins, solid success, an idea of consensus from what is a quality of quality.
It's practically not the proof of Beijing.
And I don't think I should be, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in an ambassador where men and women hide during the restrictions of the hostages.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this hiding, and it's the great moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say,``You come to bed, honey? ''
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 more popular movies, how many of them think they have female protagonists?
It's not wrong.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we have recently chosen for Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a greater number that's going to be disappointed this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music videos or pornography are closely linked, but something wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think of is there is a lot of sexual assault.
Who are those guys? What are those guys learning?
What don't you get to learn?
Are you looking at the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the villain with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and doesn't talk?
Are we looking at that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistics, and we want to prepare them.
We have tools to our disposal as a power garden, and we hope that help, but I have to ask, is it worth going to protect them if, at the same time, active or passively, are we educating our children to keep their male power?
I mean, I think Netflix's list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of men.
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You'll have read about how the new economy is changing the role that is taking care of home and the audience.
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter, what was his favorite character from Star Wars?
Obama.
So, obviously, or Global Kong.
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies who know more than nobody, and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my son: Go and struggle only and more stories where his work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, help other people improve and be better people, like the Wizard of Oz.
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I liked the most was looking for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these shells.
They're covered from sand, and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I used to look for them.
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them.
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the archaeology.
And finally when I started studying Egypt, I realized about my own eyes not enough.
Because suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown to one of almost 3,000 miles from length to the Nile.
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to using satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see otherwise.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using infrared.
This is a place located in the eastern Delta of Egypt called Benjamin.
And the place, at the simple view, seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like bright pink.
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptians.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city called Italian, lost for thousands of years.
Italian was the old Egypt capital for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in Cairo, Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of the ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
The skeptics have always known that Italian was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that built them, indicated within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge airplane plan.
This area is enormous, it's about six per mile.
Before, the Nile flow right next to Titanic, and as he changed over time, he moved into the east and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a career town in an extensive landscape?
Trying to find it randomly would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a haystack, with the eyes sold and using baseball gloves.
So, we use NASA police data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We could see where the Nile flows.
But you can see more detail, and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, that we think it could be the location of Italian.
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists doing sample work; you can see it here.
When I say show, it's like the sample shots in ice, but instead of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation.
Five meters below, under a thick thick layer, we found a dense layer of pottery objects.
This means that in this possible location of Italy, five meters down, we have a opportunity layer of several hundred years, which data from the Middle Empire, exactly the same period that we think is Italian.
We also found the jobs of parenting, corner, square and cat, which shows that there was a jewelry workshop there.
This might seem like it's not much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the Middle Empire jewelry, these are the stones that were used.
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that data from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a law jewelry workshop that shows that what's been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find Italian here, but we go back to the place in a near future to locate it.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also make big discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire, and I was probably written in Italy 4,000 years ago.
sharing knowledge is the biggest of all voices.
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to it, TED wasn't founded in 1984.
It makes the ideas really happen in 1984 to C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from high.
It certainly puts the search for marine shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that it's made.
Now visualizing a group of obese outstauches in bicycles.
They're competing in a middle bicycle race, and they're going to address their entry door.
I need you to see this really.
They're getting strong, they're sweating, they're jumping a lot.
And they collide against the door of his house.
There are bicycles flying all over the place, wheels that pass on their side, rays from the wheels that end up in absurd places.
To the lobby, or the hallway, or what's on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light, the shine light on the Galapagos monster.
It's waving them with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speaks.
You can feel your blue ball making them tickle in the nose.
You can smell the aircraft cookie, and you're about to get in your mouth.
They walk on one side and train their living room.
Already in the room, and making a maximum use of its imagination, imagine Britney Spears.
He's with little clothes, dancing about his center table, singing``Hey Mary One More . ''
Now let me get the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow brick path, and from the oven, they come to you Dorothy, the Hangina man, the Samara and the lion of``The Wizard of Oz ,"taken out of the hands, jumping into you.
Okay . Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that's taken on every spring in New York.
It's called the United States Service Campaign.
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist, waiting, I guess, that this was like the end of a sandwich.
There were several men and a few ladies of different ages and different hygiene habits.
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers, looking at them once.
They would memorize the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
They would memorize whole poems in just minutes.
They compete to see who he could memorize with greater price the order of a nylon deck.
And I thought,``This is incredible . ''
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England, and he had one of the best trained memories.
I said,``Ed, when did you realize you were a wise? ''
Ed says,``I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who's involved from this competition say they have normal memory.
\" We have trained us to perform these miracle acts of memory using some ancient techniques, invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that Cicero used to memorize their speeches, and that medieval academics used to memorize entire books . ''
And my reaction was,``Wow . How did I haven't heard of this before? ''
We were standing out of the classroom, and Ed, who is a wonderful and brilliant English English, although a little bit excited, said,``Josh, you're an American journalist.
Do you know Britney Spears? ''
And I said,``What? No, why?
\" Because I'd like to teach Britney Spears how to memorize order in a living bus deck, in national television.
That would test the world that anyone can do it . ''
And I said,``Well, I'm not Britney Spears, but maybe you can teach me.
So you have to start for something, right? ''
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year, not only training my memory, but also researching, trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called PP.
He's an ordinary, very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that he didn't even remember that he had a memory problem; it's awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim Pept . He was based on Duke Hoffman's role in the movie``Rain Man . ''
We spent a afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City, memorizing phone books; it was inexpened.
And by coming back, a lot of treaties about writing memory does something over 2,000 years in Latin, in the ancient and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having trained, disciplined, growing memory was not a thing as weird as you can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they've also changed us.
They have changed us culturally, and I would say that they have changed as well.
As we almost don't have need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people are still passionate about this idea of trained, disciplined, cultured memory is this very unique memory of memory.
It's actually not so singular; there are competition like this around the world.
I was fascinated, I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at the University College in London invited a group of memory champions, the lab.
Would you want to know: will it be that it has brains in some way, structural or intuitively different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more intelligent than the rest?
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects with which they compare them.
When they put them into a magnetic resonance machine, they scan their brains as they memorized numbers, faces and forms of snow copies . They found that memory champions were lighting up parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually used, or they seemed to use, a part of the brain that involves space and navigation memory.
Why? Is there something that we can learn from this?
The tournament of competitive memory is driving as an armed career where every year comes out with a new way of remembering more things, faster, and then the rest of competitors should be put a day.
This is my friend Ben Prize, three times champion.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 disposable rides that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he mastered.
He used a similar technique to memorize the accurate order of 544 random binary digits.
In half a hour, yes.
And while there's a big number of ways to remember things in these competence, absolutely all the techniques that are used in the end are reduced to a single concept that psychologists call``electronic coding . ''
It's illustrated with a elegant paradox known as``Baker"paradox.
That's his appeal.
And then I ask you,``Remember there's a bath . ''
And when I come back later, and I ask them,``Remember that word I told you a while ago? ''
\" Remember what was it? ''
The person who told her that their name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person said to her work is``battle . ''
Same word, different capacity to remember; that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, it doesn't really mean anything for you.
With all the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word,``Baker"-- we know baker.
They use simple white hats.
They have flour in their hands.
They smell well when they go home to work.
We probably know some baker.
And when we first heard that word for the first time, we started putting some associated hooks to fish them easily at some point.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this data from 2,500 years ago in the Old Greece.
It's known as the``memory of memory . ''
The story is like this: there was a poet called similarities that attended a banker.
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it didn't go to a DJ, it hired a poet.
He stood up, he got his memory poem, and he got sick, and so soon it was, the hall of the block collapsed.
killing everyone.
But not only killed them all, but it destroys the bodies leaving the bodies.
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't bury the bodies.
A tragedy behind each other.
symmetries, stop outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed your eyes and realized that with your mind's eyes, you could see where each invited.
I took the family family, taking them where their loved ones were loved between rubble.
So what similarities came in at that moment is something that we all know more or less intuitively, and it's that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions for our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional space.
If you asked me to give you the first 10 words of the story that I just told you from similarities, it's very likely to be really hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who was sitting on the prison horse, brown in their lobby, they would be able to visualize it.
The idea of memory palace is to create this building with your mind's eyes and put it out of images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy, disappear, funny, scanned and smelly, is the image, more unforgettable.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties, in Latin.
And how does it work?
Let's say you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk, and you want to make it in memory, in the same way that Cicero had done if you had invited it to TEDx 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And I'm going to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy, unforgettable image to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely simple competition.
And then you can imagine getting into your house, and you can see the monster of the Galapagos Mountains Mountains.
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed Cook.
And then you would see Britney Spears to remind them that funny anecdote that they want to count.
And then they would go into the kitchen, and the fourth topic they would talk about would be that strange journey they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how the Roman speakers memorize their speeches, not word for word, that's going to confuse them but, typical for typical.
In fact the term``typical ,"comes from the Greek``tourism ,"which means``place . ''
It's a dress of when people thought about the prayer and the rhetoric with this kind of space term.
The phrase``first ,"it would be like the first place in your memory palazzo.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got out of full of it.
I went to some of these memory competitions, and I had the idea of writing something except about this superconduction of competitive memorized.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a particularly boring event.
In serious, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting by taking tests . I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone is driving the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are incredible things happening in these people's minds, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to get in its place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem . Or the names of an ancient school worker bought in a thumb market.
And I found this was surprisingly entertaining.
I'd never expected it to be.
It was entertaining, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's actually about doing is to improve more and more capacity to create and imagine these ridiculous, common images, compliant, instantly, absurd and observer.
I'm pretty hooked with this.
This is me, using my standard standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of ears, and some security goggles covered with tape leaving only two holes, because distraction is the worst enemy of a memory competitor.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before . I had the idea that I could enter, in a kind of participatory experiment.
I thought this could be very good for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the contest, something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to memorize speeches, and phone numbers, and shopping lists, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because it's based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be put to build memory sticks or memorize cards, to benefit with a little bit of perspective about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was an innate gift, but it's not the case.
Great memories are educated.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we focused deeply.
The memory of memory -- these memory techniques, they're just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even real shortcuts.
They work because they make us work.
They force a kind of a deep processing, a kind of complete attention that most of us don't go out there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things are made.
And if there's something I want to leave you today, it's what PIPA, the communication that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what's already our short existence in the Blackberries or iPhones, not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks on our side . Are we going to be so hopeful that we don't even bother ourselves in depth?
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'll talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we're going to address just a complex place: New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from N Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at my parents' house in a village called Liberia, and this was my child bedroom.
On the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And, between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the room to be.
And there they all spent the time watching the television . So every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me . And every time I was shower and I came back in a towel, everybody saw me.
And I was like this.
It was clumsy, insecure and hated it.
I hated that tour, hated that balcony, hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
Ready.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, no division of areas, but of those visceral connections, emotional, that we feel in the places we occupy.
And it's not surprising that we sit in that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency, Americans spend 90 percent of their time under ceiling.
I mean , 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what I do: they think about power, stability, and``democracy . ''
And I know that you think about it, for based on a building built about 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a disorder that architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a predictable emotional connection; we've used this trick for a long time, a long time ago.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in the United States, we used it to build houses.
Look, these stable, solid soldiers, in front of the sea, removed from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who build, the urbanization and the governments, they always have fear to innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice building.
It's the Liberia Public Library that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a dome; it has this round thing, columns, red brick, that let you get into what Linux tries to communicate with this building: children, property values, history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year in 2004, on the other side of the country, another library was finished, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to meet, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both of us called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the pendulum.
On one side is innovation -- architects that are constantly pushing new technologies, new technologies, new solutions for the forms of life.
We drive, we push and drive so much, we're completely pulling out of people.
All black, this depressed us . You think we feel very well, but we're dead, because we don't have another option.
We have to go on the other side and come back to connect with these appreciated symbols.
So we do it, and we're all happy, but we're all happy, so we're starting to experience again; we're making the pendulum back back, over and over again, so we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well 30 years ago, we came out of the '70s.
Architects were busy experimenting with the so-called``brain . ''
It's got to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
Small windows, in dehumanizing.
Something really hard.
So we came up to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We pushed the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know, and we updated them.
We add together and add cake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give up.
We took Basin bursters, and we converted them into skyscrapers, which can be medieval machines made of glass.
The shapes are added, they won in audacity and colorful.
The Indians became columns.
The swan grew up to the size of buildings.
A madness.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own architectural fantasies.
Those fantasies could be to the Mediterranean, to the French, or the Italian.
It could possibly be a pile of bread sticks.
This is what happens with the programmers.
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we're receiving memories from other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the Tuscany.
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated, and we start making the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the '80s, in the early '80s, we started experimenting with the so-called depressing.
We're descending the historical symbols; we now count with new computer tracking techniques, and we find new compositions -- a few ways that star against other forms.
This is academic and embryonic, and it's super implant; you're totally excluded.
Normally, the punctual pendulum again in opposite direction.
But then something surprising happened.
In 1997, this building is opened.
It's the Guggenheim of Bilbao, Frank Gehry.
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul Goldberg said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when criticism, academic and public in general, were completely agreement about a building.
The New York Times rating this miracle building.
Bilbao in Bilbao increased by 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those buildings: Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Sergio.
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible that these forms, wild and radical, how is it possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was all around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same as the major mayor of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the new millennia happened with other star architects.
I happened to Zach and Linda, and what happened with these few elite architects in the new army threshold, actually began to pass with all architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about, for example, how architecture is consumed.
A thousand years ago, they'd have to walk up to the next town to see a building.
Transport accelerated: You can take a ship, an airplane, you can be tourists.
The technology accelerated . You can see in the newspapers, in the television, and at the end, we are all architectural photographers, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
Architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before knowing whether that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
Brains was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years old.
So for 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they stopped.
That's never going to happen . I think, because we're in the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of concrete, steel or elevator, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the media of the media, it starts getting faster and faster, until you're in both extreme extremes almost in the simultaneous, and it's effectively drawing the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects, and you, the audience.
Now we can make similar symbols, with emotional charge, of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were hired to replace this building that was fire.
This is the center of a village called Pints in Fine Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building was finished, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly the finished product, there were no surprises.
The building became part of the community . That first summer, when people began to come and shared it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, they're the images that one made from the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes corrupts with collective memory, and by charge these symbols, we learn.
That is, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other, what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think for a second in those libraries of Liberia.
If that building is built today, we're first going to the Internet looking for``new libraries . ''
We would be bombarded with examples of experimentation, innovation, about what a library can be.
That's the ammunition.
Music that can lead to the mayor of Liberia, to people in Liberia, and tell you that there is no unique response to what a library can be today.
We're part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use granding words and complicated drawings, and you're no longer a hapless audience that doesn't accept something that I haven't seen before.
Architects can listen, and you don't let the architecture go into the architecture.
That means that the ancestral pendulum of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of architecture history, and it means that tomorrow buildings will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the old city of wisdom can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick brick based on ideas of what a stadium should be.
This means that a few robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways they're going to produce.
That means that buildings are embedded to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make sports or yoga, or even one can marry in the night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East River in New York, and raise half a million dollars from the community together around that cause, no is a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little string pavilion, as muscle and fibrous as the animals that are going to look at.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
No matter how we build, what matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make more ecological buildings, smarter and more friendly buildings.
We've been waiting for all of you to want them.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, control it and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they shape the smallest spaces: local libraries, homes where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my niece, Steve.
He just turned a year and she started walking.
And it does it in that great, typical way of children in a year, taking, as if your body was moving too fast for your legs.
It's totally precious.
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It's laughing and Chile, and it gives themselves those big and wet kisses.
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of your friends do this, and my mom tells me I used to do it . And he made me think, when stop doing this?
How do we suddenly not taste with our appearance?
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month , 10,000 people look for Google,``Am I ugly? ''
This is Facebook , 13 years old and lives in Denver.
And as any teenager, just wants to be loved and fit.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little scary, it's a little confused, because even though his mom says all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
Among what his mom says, and what his friends, or school colleagues tell him, doesn't know who to believe.
So it makes a video of her, publishes it in YouTube, and ask others to please a comment,``Am I nice or am I ugly? ''
Well, so far, Facebook has received more than 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so disgusting, that it doesn't even deserve the word to think about them.
We talk about a healthy, normal and current teenager, who receives these answers in one of the most vulnerable stages of their most vulnerable.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's driving them to do this?
Well, the teenagers of today are almost never alone.
They're under the pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, chatting, giving``I like ,"by saying, sharing, publishing, this never ends.
We've never been so connected before, continuously, instant, so young.
As a mother said to me,``It's like there's a party in your room every night . ''
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from your hand with that are implant.
This environment, to be always connected, is adding our children to automatically based on the number of``I like"that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is manipulated digitally.
What is the most neglected thing in someone's life in front of what is normal in a daily context?
So where are you looking for inspiration?
Well, you can see the kinds of images that are cover from the girls' news.
The zero-sum models continue to dominate our passports.
The technique of the Abraham is now a routine.
And trends like: Thomas, the biomass, of biomass and profession.
For those who unknown it, it means professional.
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what young people are compared.
But kids aren't immune to this.
It's like the superheroes of the sports of sports, and the reporter singers.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, surely we want our children to grow healthy and be individuals well balanced.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities, their studies and others start to suffer.
Six out of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see the beautiful enough.
These are not trivial activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as a taxpayer to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in class arguments . They avoid to participate in classrooms, because they don't want to call attention for their physical aspect.
One in five are not attending classes at all during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you see enough good enough, specifically if you don't think you're thin enough, you'll get a less note to the average of your peers who don't worry about that.
And this phenomenon has been generated in Finland, the United States and China.
And it's regardless of what actually weigh these young people.
So, so it's very clear, we're talking about how you see, not how you're really.
The low self-esteem on its body is developing academic performance.
And it's also devoting health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more nonviolent diet than they can take them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily influenced by the people who surround them and they are in greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this, so they make more risky decisions, like alcohol consumption and drugs, dramatic diets, aesthetic surgery, sexual relationships to early ages and no protection and self-reporting damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling it.
Women who think they have overweight again, regardless of whether they have or they don't have any greater rates of assistance.
17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way they look.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that opportunity be?
releasing this potential is from interest to each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms . The first one is we have to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of good programs, without realizing, worse the situation.
So, we need to make sure that the program that followed our children not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas . The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial parties for anyone willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is fundamental, but facing this problem requires each of us that we take the injuries in the issue, and we're a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
And challenging the current status of how women are viewed and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to count with the contribution of our politicians in hair cuts or the size of their breasts, or to insist that determination or success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to start judging people for what they are, not as they see.
We can all start by taking responsibility by the kinds of images and comments we published in our social networks.
We can choose people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you,``When was the last time you were drinking a mirror? ''
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to truly change our culture, so our children grow up to value all their people, valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a pedestal.
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that come out on the big screen because we only create a different world.
A world where our children are free to becoming the best version of themselves, where the way they think they're never seen to be who they are, or reaching what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who's in mind?
Her wife?
Her sister?
Her daughter?
To your niece? Is your friend?
It could be simply the woman who is at two seats of distance . What would it mean for her if it was released from that authority voice in his inside, that I'm terrified by not having long legs, more thin, more flat, smaller feet?
What would it mean for it if we knew this, and would we say it leads to its potential that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is catching us all.
But let's teach our children the truth.
Let's show that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them by who they are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
We include self-esteem in our schools.
We change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And we're working together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little tribes of a age today, they become agents of safe change.
Let's do it.
The five of November , 1990, a gentleman called Soliarrs Nasher entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the Arab Merch Katrington, the leader of the Swiss Defense League.
We initially declared it innocent, but being prisoners of other minor charges, in the company of others, started planning attacks to about 12 New York icons, including tunnels, synagogues and the United Nations headquarters.
Luckily, those plans were frustrated by an FBI informant.
Sadly, the 1993 bomb in the World Trade Center could not avoid.
Later, we would be convicted by his participation in that attack.
Scott Nashind is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a Egyptian engineer, with a lovely American mother teacher, and between the two made the whole possible for a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, which very few, including most Muslims, come to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all human groups, there is always a little fraction of people who are so likely to have their convictions that they think that we have to use all possible media to live like them.
A few months before the arrest, he felt with me and explained that in the last few weekends, he and some friends, they had been going to the story training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the Pole of Carrow, which, without knowing our group, was overwhelmed by the FBI.
When I got to throw my father, my father helped me holding my rifle on the shoulder and explained how to aim the target at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that shot I gave the little orange light on the target, and for everybody, especially mine, all the goal is in flames.
My uncle turned to the other and in Arabic, he said,``You know,``Iran book . ''
Such a parent, such a son.
For all, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but only a few years later, I understood what they did so funny.
They saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause.
Those people later would be convicted by putting up a coal with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking season of the North Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and iron to another 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them``hmm ,"which means uncle.
When I was 19, I had moved 20 times . That instability during my childhood didn't allow me to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone, it was time to pack and get another city.
As I was always, the new face of the class was often victims of killing.
I was a secret convention of my identity to avoid being the white, but it will be the new of the class, silence and a regular, and it was enough ammunition.
So most of the time I spent it in home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons, it doesn't develop social skills, to say it softly -- because growing under fanciful, I wasn't prepared for the real world.
They educate me to judge people, based on arbitrary indicators, like their race or religion.
So how could you open your eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my thinking, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a preliminary program that I participated in the Journal National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was focused on the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been victims of killing almost all my life, it was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different backgrounds.
One day, at the end of the convention, I found one of the kids who had made friendship, was Jewish.
I took a few days to go out to the light this detail, and I realized that there was no animation between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend, and frankly I felt very proud of having been able to beat the barrier that all of life had made me believe that it was influence.
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush Gardens, a amusement park.
I found people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures . That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
The whole life was taught to me that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension, all the homosexual was bad influences.
By chance, I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most labor and less critical I had seen in life.
Having been bullied, it developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat friendly people, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is to be a homosexual, but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the``Daily Show . ''
Every night, Jon Stewart made me intellectually honest about my intolerance, and I helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my poker figure at a moment when I was desperately needed.
In times, inspiration can come from unexpected, and that a Jewish comedian had a better influence in my life than my own father, extremists, was not in vain.
One day, I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that I would conserve in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless pragmatism, and he said,``I'm tired of hate . ''
At that time, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all of that hate inside.
My real name is not Zach Barrack.
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I decide to go out and put in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody, one day, who you're trying to bring to violence, you can hear my story and understand that there's a better way, that although I was convicted to this violent and intellectual ideology, I didn't get to make me fantastic.
Instead, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk, against those acts without meaning, as a rejection to my father's actions.
With this simple simple, I'm exposed to myself as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow their parents's paths.
I'm not my father.
Thank you . Thank you all . Thank you . Thank you.
Right now, there's a movie that's projected in your minds.
It's an incredible multitasking film.
It's in 3D, and it has a sound sound of what you hear and see right now . But that's just the beginning.
Your film has harmony, taste and texture.
Feel your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that you're projecting to your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice in your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie are you who experience everything in direct.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the human being.
Every one of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least, I know I have a consciousness of it.
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we weren't aware, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why do we have these internal movies?
Why aren't we just robots that we've got to produce outcomes without experiencing the internal film?
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science, by nature, is objective.
Consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, I predict that vision.
The psychology studied the behavior, the neuroscience studied the brain objectively, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Then , 20 years ago, everything began to change.
neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Persia said,``Now it's time for science to address consciousness . ''
And since then, there was a real explosion, a flourishing of scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic . It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to time.
The center of consciousness science in the recent years was the pursuit of correlations, correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy Kanzi introduced a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the brain areas that are related to conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of correlations.
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness: questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they're correlated.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
It's not offense to neuroscientists.
There are actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, I don't address the real central mystery of this matter: why all physical processes in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a subjective internal film?
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, give a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like embassies, like hurricanes, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical contributions are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate the packaging, how hurricanes work, how they reproduce, adapt and metabolize living organisms . They're all questions about objective function.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and function of the human brain as an emerging phenomenon: how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess; they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why all behavior is accompanied from a subjective experience?
And here is, the standard paradigm of the emergence, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't really have a lot to say.
I'm a scientific heart material.
I want a scientific theory of adoption that works . For a long time, I hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end, I got to the conclusion that that didn't work for systematic reasons.
I think we sit at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations, great . We're used to this; physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
On the other hand, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is a kind of anomaly, something we need to integrate to our worldview, but we don't know yet how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas . I think we need ideas that at the beginning look crazy, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Your crazy idea is there is no such a hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the inner subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain objective functions, brain behaviors, and so you study everything you need.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely reductionist consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to just denial that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I, I'm in a different direction.
In the time I left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promising.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental bricks: space, time and mass.
Post fundamental laws that govern them, like gravity laws or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explained in terms of anything more basic.
Instead, they're considered fundamental, and that's where the world is built.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is rented.
In the 19th century, Manhattan discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts, space, time, mass, Newton law, then put the basic laws of electromagnetism, and put the electric burden as a fundamental concept that those laws govern.
I think that's the situation we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, time, mass, charge, then by logic, you have to stick the list.
The most natural thing would be to put consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not about science.
It opens the path to scientifically handle it.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts: space, time, mass, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can stay in a limb.
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can stay in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws they are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes is called psychiatrists:``bread ,"for all,``psychiatry"by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies, even the microbes of Rob Knight, the elementary particles.
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or thinking.
It's not that a photon can be full of anguish when you think,``Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the rose . ''
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of raw sense, subjective, some primitive precursor of consciousness.
This can sound a little crazy for you.
How would anyone think something so crazy?
In part, it comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is fundamental.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, like the others.
It's worth noticing that although the idea seems illogical, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and most powerful way to find fundamental laws that relate to the physical process, is to link consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing, there's consciousness.
Processing information processing, like a human being, complex consciousness.
Simple information processing, simple consciousness.
And so something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, Gillark Tong, took this kind of theory and developed it regularly with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical intelligence of information, which is called a child, which measures the degree of integrated information in a system.
And I guess I have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high child, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a middle degree of information integration, just as much significant, of a fairly important awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of the owl said.
The information level is lower, but it's not zero either.
In the theory of Tanzania, there will be still a level of different awareness of zero.
It actually provides a fundamental law of consciousness: high degree of owl, high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that psychiatrists can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
physicists and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk to us about the reality that underlies underneath.
As Stephen Hawking explains,``Where is the fire of the equations? ''
From the personal vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but can be used to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically, describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found out of the physical world as a kind of additive.
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I, I think, the passive vision, has the potential to transform our relationship with nature, and can have social consequences and pretty serious ethical consequences.
Some can be illogical.
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then it had to be vegetarian.
If you're a pasture and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think thinking about it, this tends to transform your visions, whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral consideration, it's not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the Samantha artificial intelligence system in the movie``Hero"?
Is it conscious?
According to the view of passionate information, she has a complicated process of information, integrated, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, it's a pretty serious ethical problem about the development of the development of intelligent computers and the ethics of leaving them.
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of complete collective, the planet.
Does Canada have its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk . Right now, we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movies of each of the parts?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that has to take seriously.
So this past-controlled view, it's a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer than the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second one, that it's universal.
Vision raises many questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path towards a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we will finally find it out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, a low education profile.
I went to school, I joined my friends, I caught me with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to name for a community prize.
And my parents said,``Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She's actually not got anything ."And they were right.
I went to school, I had good notes . After school, I had a low profile on my mother's hair, and I spent a lot of time looking at the``Bush the Value The Value"and``Dadge's Creek . ''
Yes, I know . What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that I can consider as a achievement if we took disability outside the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of the teaching in Melbourne's high school, just after about 20 minutes at class 11, a boy raised his hand and said,``Hey, when will you give your speech? ''
And I said,``What's a speech? ''
Well, I had been talking about the law of difficulty for good 20 minutes.
And he said,``You know, your motivation discourse.
When people in wheelchair, talk about inspiring things in school? ''
\" Usually, in the act of acts . ''
And that was when I realized, this kid had had experiences with people with disabilities as an inspiration objects.
And we're not . And it's not a fault fault, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our manuscripts.
We're not real people . We're there to inspire.
And, in fact, I'm on this stage looking at what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting to inspire them . Right? Yes.
Well ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid to disappoint them.
I'm not here to inspire you.
I'm here to tell you that they have lied to disability.
Yes, they've sold us the lie that disability is something bad, A Bassem, mass M.
It's bad and living with a disability makes you exceptional.
It's not bad, and it doesn't make it exceptional.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this:``The only disability in life is a bad attitude . ''
Or this one:``Your excuse is invented ."Indeed.
Or this one:``Before leaving, intellect! ''
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may be you've seen one, from the hand without hands drawing with a pencil on the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with legs of carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the bottom term deliberately, because they have a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we matched the disabled disabled of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is to inspire them, motivate them, so we can see them and think,``Well, very bad it's my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person . ''
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that they have been able to express that they think I'm a brave or a source of inspiration, and this happened before my work had a public profile.
It was like I'm happy to wake up in the morning and remember my own name . And this is to sew.
These images, those images are considered the people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something difficult.
We overcome some things.
But the things we overcome is not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term``disabled people ,"deliberately because I subscribe to the social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnoses.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited with him.
It does the things I need you to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your capacity as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those photos too.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So is it really fair to sew them in the way we do, by sharing those images?
When people say,``You're a source of inspiration ,"it's like a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us exceptional.
And honestly, it doesn't.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here by building inspiration, and you think,``Oh God, you're not sometimes inspired by something? ''
And actually, I know I am.
I learn from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't learn that I'm more lucky than them.
Now, learning that it's a great idea to use a little bit of barbecue paint to collect the things that you fall to me . I learn the ingenious trick of how to load the mobile phone battery in the chair of the chair.
Great.
We learn from the strength and the resistance of others, not against our bodies and our diagnosis, but against a world that we're going to do and we care about it.
I really believe that that lie that have sold us about disability is the biggest injustice.
It makes us hard life.
And that quote:``The only disability in life is a bad attitude ,"the reason that's lying is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a stairs of stairs has never made it into a ramp.
Never . smile on a television screen won't make the subtitles appear for deaf people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and raising a positive attitude to turn all those books into the braille.
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching``Bush the Valentina ,"is not considered anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the disabled people that we are happy to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a 11 degree boy at a high school in Melbourne is not a kind of surprising that its new teacher is a wheelchair users.
disability doesn't make us exceptional, but question what you think you know about, you know it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional football, with empathy?
And what is the average speed of a closed chicken?
Unfortunately, today, I'll only answer one of those questions, so please don't get rid.
When people really think about augmented reality, it thinks about``Minority Report"and in Tom Cruise, saving the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
The augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because reality is going to change our lives as much as the Internet and the mobile phones.
So how do we get to augmented reality?
The first step, it's what I'm wearing: the Google Glass goggles.
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you may not know is Google Glass is a device that allows them to see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is being a professional sport in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to describe them.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass under a helmet and know what's running through the game field at 100 miles, the blood hitting your ears.
We can know that you feel that a man of 110 pounds will persist us, trying to get rid of all its self.
I've been there and I assure you that it's nothing nice.
I bring some videos to show you what the Google Glass is under the helmet, and give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not the images of the NFL practice, because the idea of the NGOs of emerging technology is a submarine rising the surface . But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris Klein: Come on.
It's horrible to be tapired.
A moment . Let's zoom.
Are you ready?
Go!
Chris Klein: As you can see, it's a proof of what is being taken in the football field, from the perspective of the tobacco.
You'll have noticed that you need people, the rest of the team.
We've got a video of them, the University of Washington University.
field miraculous: mice 54! Mice!
Blue 8: Blue 8! Come!
Chris Klein: This is a little bit more about feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the NFL.
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players, and I've been asked in YouTube and Twitter,``You can see from the angle of a field Navy.
Or a corridor?
We want to experience that . ''
Once we have that experience with Google and Google Glass, how do we get full, how do we take it to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called Occupy Rift, which surely many of you know.
The Occupy Rift has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap word.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, oh!
No, no, no! I don't want to keep playing! No!
Oh, my God! Oh!
CK: That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain, starting for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we record a video from Adrian Peter crossing the line, getting rid of a tablet with your arm before you run and make an notation? What will be the experience of a fan.
When I can be Mest running through the court, launching the ball at the bottom of the network? Or Fediment making a leap in Vietnam?
What will be your experience when it's descended from a mountain to over 100 miles as a Olympic skier?
Maybe you increase the adults for adults.
But this is not even augmented.
It's just virtual reality, Roger.
How do we get the augmented reality, RISD?
We'll reach the augmented reality when the coaches, the molecules and owners see what people want to see and think,``How do we use this to improve our teams?
How do we use it to win games? ''
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win . They give them money.
So, here's a short refresher on the technology in the NFL.
In 1965, the Baltimore Towers put a little bit of a test to their field sandstone to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to imitate them.
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the NFL put radio in the houses of the fields and then in the defense.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In 2013, imagine you're a player coming back to your group, and you see their next player shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you're wearing . You're not going to have to worry about forgetting a player.
It's to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and react.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate losing parts.
If you lose, you lose yourself as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just a manual of better strategies.
The augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would it be done?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner of the stadium, having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get the information from the hull sensors and the accelerometer, something that's already working.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know that.
The bad ones will have overload.
This will differentiate the good teams of evil.
So your computer team will be as important as your receptors, and data analysis will stop being just for nerds.
Who would have imagined it? Who would have imagined it?
What would it be in the field?
Imagine you're the field puppets.
You get the ball and you go back.
You look at an open receptor . Suddenly, a flashlight in the left side of your bombsight prevents you that a defense behind you is going to attack . Normally, you wouldn't see it, but the RCA system is sent.
You go into the protection area.
Another flashlight prevents you there is an open receptor.
You toss the ball, but you give up the ball.
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, though, the receptor sees in its view an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
You approach, catch the ball, run and encourage.
The audience is coming up and fans have followed the player from each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the party.
I'll make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
The augmented reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is: Do we want this to be the only use of augmented reality?
Are we going to use it just as bread and circus, like our usual entertainment?
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, to be in somebody else's place.
We know what this technology is worth for the sporting light.
It generates billions of revenue a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show an abuse how harmful their actions are from the perspective of victim?
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia, trying to show the world how it's being pursued?
How much is it worth for a Haitian Cambodian or a Neil Deafoloca Tyson trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of tribal notes and Kansas?
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is about.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, depend on, as always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently retired after 23 years of service at the Habric Heritage of California.
Most of those 23 years I spent me by beating the southern end of Marine County, including the Golden Gate Bridge.
The bridge is an iconic structure, which is known to its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in 1973.
Joseph Strateges, an engineer chief engineer to build the bridge, said,``The bridge is practically testing.
So suicide from the bridge is not practical or likely . ''
But from his openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you think you'll travel between the two towers, you'll take it to another dimension, this bridge has been idealized as such, such that every single one from it is freed out of all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go down below your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free four to five seconds, the body chocolate against the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones, some of which you're carrying vital organs.
Most people die in impact.
The ones that no, they normally fall into the helpless water and then drowned.
I don't think that those of you who control this method of suicide is aware of the death of the death that you will face.
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 parallel steel inches to the bridge.
This is where most people are standing before they take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in their darkest moment, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man spoke with an officer by having his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we succeeded that day to bring it back on the railing.
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
We fought to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who have the suicide, but the officers too.
We've run a long way since.
Today, veterans and psychologists train new officials.
This is Jason Garden.
I met him on July 22 last year to receive a call from a possible suicide subject sitting on the ridge near the center.
I answered, and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking to an official from the Golden Gate Bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old and flew up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here twice before New Jersey to try to suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour speaking with Jason, he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.
Remember the Greek mythology, Zean created Pandora, and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said,``Never, you never open that box . ''
Well, one day, curiosity could more than Pandora, and she opened the box.
And it came out pest, sorrows, and all kinds of bad against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us,``What if you open the box and there's no hope? ''
He stopped a few times, he leaned on the right, and he went.
This very clever and intelligent boy in New Jersey had just taken his life.
I spoke to the parents of Jason that night, and I I I I I I I I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family's rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents in Jason had asked him.
So the collective damage of suicide affect many people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved outside?
What would you say?
Do you know what to say?
In my experience, not only you have to talk, but you have to listen.
Listen to understand.
Don't argue, blame, or tell the person you know how it feels, because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point they need.
If you think somebody is suicide, you're not afraid of dealing with them and asking the question.
One way to ask them the question is,``Other in similar circumstances have thought to end their life; have these thoughts? ''
Confined the person in front of it can save life and be the point of inflection for them.
Other signs to look: despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to improve; helplessness, believe that there's nothing you can do about it -- recent social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read her letter.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he's with his permission and he was blessed to read it.
\" Hi, Kevin . I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still pretty sensitive, but noticing more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from Petrious to San Francisco to see the 49 with his father the 19 of January.
He never got there.
I called the ketchup police and reported it as a disappeared night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported that Mike's car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen it jumping from the bridge at 185 o'clock in the evening.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without suffering a real mental illness?
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The GMT, the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, Victor . ''
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and run the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 , 2005, I responded to a radio call for a possible suicide subject on the sidewalk of the north tower.
I drove my two-wheeler, and I looked at this man, Kevin Berkeley, standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, I immediately crossed the railing, and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the next hour and a half, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day back to that lane and giving life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, happiness.
\" This is a new start, a new life . ''
But I said,``What was it that made you go back and give the hope and life another opportunity? ''
And you know what he told me?
He said,``I hear myself.
I'll let you talk and just listen . ''
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from Kevin's mother, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to read you.
\" Dear Lord Book, nothing will delete the 11 of March 11, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows us.
I think Kevin was celebrating for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly medication.
I adopted Kevin when I only had six months, completely unaware of all of those inherited traits, but, thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We thank God for you.
Just in debt with you, Norman Bertie . ''
And at the end she wrote,``PR . When I visited the San Francisco General Hospital that night, you would figure out as the patient.
\" Wow, I had to solve it! ''
Now, Kevin is an active father and a member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story inspired others.
suicide is not just something I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather suicide with poison.
That act, despite finishing its own pain, stole me the opportunity to meet it.
This is what the suicide does.
For most of the suicide people, or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about getting somebody else.
They just want their own pain.
Usually, this is only about three ways: sleep or drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded, and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and call around the bridge.
Of those incidents I've been directly involved in, I just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was Jason.
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I cut my hand on three times.
On the final squeeze, I looked at me, and he said,``Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go . ''
And I jumped.
Horring, absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we have to contact in that bridge are not suicide.
Also, those few who have jumped out of the bridge and live, and they can talk about it, that one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one who left the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect Marine with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us should be striving for doing.
suicide can prevent.
There's help . There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes it what you're not, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question makes you, how do you become that?
I must be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, I'm not alone.
When I became a model, I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever had.
My outside ended with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, I I'm going to refer to you later, when I look at this picture, I think, you've got it, you get it, you get it.
But last October, I found out that, I'm just starting.
All of us are related to our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value to release, to get rid of the limited constraints by the color of the skin or the beliefs of those who are surrounding us.
These are people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered accepted.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this event is called epiphany.
This is mine.
I was registered as``kid"to birth because of the appearance of my genitals.
I remember that my five years in Los Angeles, in my house, I always carried this shirt in my head.
And my mom asked me,``Why do you always take that shirt in your head? ''
I said,``Mom, it's my hair . I I'm a girl . ''
I knew how to argue.
The gender has always been considered an amazing fact, but we now know that, really, it's something more complex and mysterious.
Because of my success, I never helped me share my story, not because I thought I'm what I'm bad, but why the world deals with those of us who want to release.
Every day I appreciate to be women.
I have mom, dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in Asia culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess, heaven of the faces.
And when I was eight, I was at a party in Los Angeles that celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something hit me: This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, I met this woman called TED.
It's the director of a transgender beauty competition.
That night, she asked me,``Why haven't you been involved in the beauty contest? ''
He told me that if I was participating, she would be commissioned from the spending of inspiration and the costume, and that night, he won a bathroom, he won in a gallery suit, and he was third funding between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty networks.
Not many people can say that their first job was a beauty of beauty of transgender women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of the depressed, especially when we traveled to remote provinces from Los Angeles.
But more importantly, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001, my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that they passed my request from the green card that I could go to to live to the United States.
I was resistant.
I told my mother,``Mommy, I'm fun.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a beauty queen . ''
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said,``You know if you moved to the United States, you can change the name and the gender identity? ''
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me I'd put two, and my name.
She also joined me when I was operating in Thailand at 19 years old.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand, they make the surgeries more prestigious, sophisticated and safe.
At that time in the United States, it was necessary to make surgery before changing the name and the gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of Gene and the``F"of female gender.
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a wheat, but for me it was the license to live, to feel dignified.
Suddenly, my fears were centralized.
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman in the Alamon Networks.
A young woman in New York who had grown up his truth, but, he was sticking, he started to end his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November, we make a global video by the Congress Day of the Transition.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who fought and stood up to injustice.
These are Marshall P. Johnson and Sylvia River.
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, exposing me, so that some day no longer there are no more 20 of November.
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Will you do?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you . KT: George, a quick question.
George Rose: Sure . You'll see, first, thank all my blessings.
to my support network, my parents, especially, to my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been attending young women who I've been doing, and I've been told, sometimes, when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it . I took the phone, called my mom and said,``Mommy, can you call this woman? ''
Sometimes it works, others not . It's just gender identity, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all get a gender to the birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that no block, and there should be a space that allows people to authenticate, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents with colleagues.
The transgender movement is starting compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
I should have understood.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you . Very nice . GH: Thank you.
In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies, parents usually meet them for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
Bad started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007, and when they married their efforts in 2011, when they got the National Prize of peace, he became very famous, a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the history of injustice, of inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in the patriarchal societies, right from the beginning, when you're born a girl, your birth doesn't celebrate.
It's not welcome, not for your father, or your mother.
The neighborhood comes, it gives her conditions to mother and nobody happy to the father.
And a mother was very overwhelmed for having a girl.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When you give birth to the second daughter, it's communicated, and with the hope of a son, when it reaches his third daughter, it feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only the mother suffer, but the daughter . The newly born daughter, when it grows, is also.
At the age of five, when I should go to school, it stays home and school admit to their siblings.
At the age of 12, somehow, it has a good life.
It can be fun.
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into the adolescence, when it turned 13, you're going to get out of your house without a male accompanied.
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's no longer a free person.
He becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and her family, and if he argued the code of that honor assumptions, he could even kill.
And it's interesting that this supposed code of honor, not only affects the life of a girl, also affects the life of male members of family.
So this brother, sacrifice the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of the honor.
And there's a norm more than the patriarchal societies that it's called the obesity.
A good girl is supposed to be very quiet, very humble and very smooth.
It's the criterion.
The model of a good girl must be quiet.
It's supposed to be silent, and that accepts the decisions of their father and her mother and the decisions of the elderly, even if it doesn't want.
If you marry it with a man who doesn't like or if you marry it with an old man, you have to accept it, because it doesn't want to be a desperate health.
If you're very young, you have to accept it.
Otherwise, they call it desperate.
And what happens at the end?
In words of a poet,``The house, they fit it, and then give birth to more children and daughters . ''
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, the same lesson of obesity to his daughter and the same honor of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
Dear brothers and sisters, when I was born, and for the first time, believe me, I didn't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely honored.
And so long before I was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a legendary fight of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Malaysia de Malawi, and he called my daughter like this for her.
But when I left, all of them were men, and I grabbed my feather, and I brought a line from my name, and I wrote,``Bad . ''
And when she grew up, when I was four and a half years old, I admit in my school.
So you will ask, why should I mention a girl's admission in a school?
Yes, I I have to tell you.
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for child's life.
And in a school, it means the recognition of his identity and his name.
An admissions to school means it's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I've got five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised, two weeks before, when I turned out the Canadian bombsight form, and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the applause of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my writing sisters in any document.
That was the reason I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the safety of my daughter.
The encouraging to sit with me when my friends came to me.
I encourage it to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to instill you in your personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for Mal.
I've made all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education education.
I teach my daughters, teach students, forget the lesson of obesity.
I teach students to forget the lesson of the so-called sandwich.
Dear brothers and sisters, we fought for more rights for women, and we fought to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It's called tailon.
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools lost.
The girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use candles and stopped going to markets.
The musicians were silenced, the sharp girls and the singing singers.
They suffered millions, but few people talked, and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and embrace when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10, Mal got up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC blog, she offered herself for the New York Times documentary, and he talked on every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It spreads as a compliment around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and October nine , 2012, they shot him to the head.
It was a fatal day for my family and me.
The world becomes a great black hole.
While my daughter was debating between life and death, I whispered the ear to my wife,``Should I blame for what happened to my daughter, your daughter? ''
And he was helpless to me,``Please, don't blame.
It's a fair cause.
You put your life in play for the cause of truth, for the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter is inspired in you and you get together.
They were both on the right path and God protect . ''
These few words meant a lot for me, and I didn't ask again.
When Mala was in the hospital, and he had severe pain pain, because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was spread through the face of my wife.
But my daughter never complained.
I used to say,``I'm okay with my tornal smile and with the entertainment in my face.
I'll be good . Please don't worry . ''
It was a comfort for us, and we got confused.
Dear brothers and sisters, we've learned from it how to resist in the hardest moments, and I I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for children's rights and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
He cried when he didn't end his homework.
It fights with his brothers, and I'm very happy about that.
People ask me,``What about special in my tutor that has made so audacious to Malaysia so brave, expressive and economic? ''
I tell you, don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I didn't do.
I don't cut their wings and that's all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you.
I was a brain operator 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineer.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Monterey group . Google, where I've had a divine to my charge -- the diversity of Google X visualization, but all the work I'm talking about today on the brain science, I did it before I joined Google or out of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you take a brain operation.
Are you just as smart or not?
Of not being like that, can you be smart?
After neurosurgery, I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and neurotransmitters.
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, I would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I have had to decide about combinations and mix mixes, and trying to get them, to follow life.
More than one time I've saved myself.
But luckily, I have a soul of experiment, so I decided that I would experience to try to get the optimal dose because there's really no clear map to say it in detail.
I started testing with different mixes, and I was surprised by seeing how small changes in the dose changed dramatically my automobile, my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly awesome case: for a few months, I tried doses and typical chemicals for a man of wind, and I was amazed by seeing how my thoughts changed.
I was always furious, I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and -- of course, many times in the past I've met several guys like this, or perhaps some attached versions.
It turns out as an extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be arrogant.
In fact, I was trying, a so much insecure, fixing a problem that I had in front of, and it simply didn't happen.
So, I couldn't handle it.
I changed my dose.
But, I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to go through . Since then, I get better with men.
What I was trying to do, when I adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, was to recover my intelligence after disease and operation -- my creative thinking, my own idea.
I tend to think about it almost always in images, and that became my key point of key reference: how do I get those mental images that I use to create prosperous, my ideas, if you want to test new ideas and reclaim situations.
This kind of thinking is not new.
Philadelphias like Hume, Descartes and Hobbes see things similar.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today, there are those who question this idea, and there are many discussions about how the mind works . To me is simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental for creative and invention thinking.
So, after several years, I get to find the right point, and I have lots of great mental images, really vivid, very sophisticated and well structured.
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images out of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what it would happen if a film director was able to use its imagination just to steer the world that has the front?
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way the creative people can be shared at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to make this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're quite close to this with two recent experiments done by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI, image for functional magnetic resonance, to represent the brain . Here you can see the brain scan done by Girlin Ganesh and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The column of the medium shows the brain scan of that same individual as you imagine, seeing that same picture.
The column on the right was created by looking at the content of the central column on the left . You see the difference is almost zero-sum.
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost zero-sum.
Now, let me share you another experiment . This is the lab of Jack Gallery in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert the brain waves in the unseen visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of YouTube videos while they were scanned their brains to create a big rise of brain reactions in the video sequences.
Then, I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and while a new scan was recorded.
The computer, using only the brain information of the scanning, I decided to show what seemed like the person was watching.
On the right you can see the computer drivers, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us vocation.
We're okay close to achieve.
We only need to improve resolution.
And now, remember when you see an image and when you imagine that same image, it's created in the brain the same map.
This was conducted with the greatest brain scanning systems available today, and its resolution is increased as a thousand times over the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we get it?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I'm not offering for that.
Many are providing new images of projection by images, even me . counting with the recent result of the MRI, first we should ask the next thing, is this technology to be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets, but at this point, larger magnets only offer small improvements in resolution, not increase by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: Instead of larger magnets, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements, like making a mirror.
And why do we care?
In the last few years, a large amount of effort in the MRI were to make really big magnets, right?
However, most of the recent advances in reversion of resourceful solutions and brilliant solutions in coding and decoding, in the transmitter and a few FM frequency receptors in the MRI systems.
Instead, rather than a magnetic magnetic field, we used structural magnetic patterns led to the FM frequency frequencies.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the FM frequency processing, we can increase the information that can be extracted in a single scan.
Also, we can then divide into layers of our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
So when we use the MBI, we should be able to measure not just the flow of blood blood, but the hormones and neurotransmitters that I mentioned and perhaps even direct neural activity . This is sleep.
We will be able to fly our ideas directly to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over language and communicate directly through thinking?
What would we be capable of?
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without filters?
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the Almast Alzheimer's cure and disease.
We have a few more options to open this door.
Anyway, you pick up a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not just a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have a closet.
Your closet may be to tell someone for the first time you love it or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you've come through in life.
All of the closet is a difficult conversation, and even though our topics can vary tremendously, the experience of having lived in that closet is universal.
It's scary, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked on the South Walemen Carlob Charling, a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the classical military intensity: not to break my armpits, quote the letters of Ann Di France as a litany.
And I'm going to be pretend that by the story of my short screen, and because I'd shave my head, I would normally ask me a little boy,``Hey, are you boy or girl? ''
And it would appear an awkward silence on the table.
I would squeeze my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a loss of anger.
The father's father immediately would love the newspaper, and the mother would launch a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I would boil inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
\" Are you a guy or a girl? ''
A family silence, but this time I was ready, and I was about to go into the female affairs on the table . I had the quote of Betty Friedman.
Gloria Steinem quote.
Even a fragment of the Vagina Monologues I would show.
And so I breathe down, and I went down the gaze and my backs, a four-year-old girl with a pink dress, looking at what's not a challenge for a feminist hurts, just a girl with a question,``Are you boys or girl? ''
So I breathe again, I put up close to her, and I said,``Hey, I, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like a guy, and I see a kid's clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable.
Well, I, I'm more than a comfortable pajamas . ''
And that girl looked at me, paying attention, and he said,``My favorite pajamas is violent and it has a fish.
Can you give me a staff, please? ''
And that was . Just``Oh, OK, you're a girl.
What about the staff I asked? ''
It was the easiest conversation of all I've ever had.
And why? Because the girl's girl and I, both of us, were honest with the other.
Just like many of us, I I've lived in some closet in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a rainbow.
But within the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
Now, surely, I'll give you 100 reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of your closet, but this is the issue: The hard thing is not relative.
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone who has been declared in a broken bank is harder than saying it's been fooled?
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder than to say to your five year-old son you're going to be divorce?
There's not something harder, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classification what's hard about what's hard to make us feel better or worse in relationship to our arms, and we should only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in the closet, and you can make it feel security, or at least safer than the other side of the door.
But I I'm here to tell you, no matter what their walls are made, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you . Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse tail, a dress and high shoe shoes.
It wasn't the military lesbian prepared to fight any four year-old children that would enter the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, curled in a corner of my dark closet, starting my great gay gay, and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing I ever done.
My family, my friends, complete strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not to disappoint them, and now the world turned around.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't release that big, you'll kill you.
One of my most memorable launch launches was on my sister wedding.
It was the first time that many of them had known that it was gay, and when I did my homework ladies, in my black dress and heels, I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents were, people who met me years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women screamed,``I love Nathan Lane! ''
And the gay clock battle had started.
\" Oh, you've ever been in the Castro? ''
\" Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San Francisco . ''
\" Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it's fabulous . ''
\" Sam, you know my Antonio star?
It's very good, and it's never talked about having girlfriend . ''
\" Sam, what is your favorite TV show?
Our favorite program? Will and Grace.
And you know who love? Jack.
Jack is our favorite . ''
And then a woman, desperate, but he's waiting to deliberately show his support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said,``Well, sometimes my husband uses pink shirt . ''
And I had an opportunity at that time, as you have all the big laundry launchers.
Now, surely, it could have been easy to indicate where they felt manipulated.
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were writing.
And what else can you ask someone else, but to strive?
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for how authentic you get.
That's how hard conversations remain without being my strong point.
Ask anyone that I've come out with.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Pantheon Chicago.
Now, please see this through gay perspective, but you understand that what it involves out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
Take the armor . Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be genuine, others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be direct . Just tell it . They're going to be rapid.
If you know they're gay, tell it.
If you say to your parents that maybe you could be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more importantly -- leave the complex.
You communicate your truth.
They never apologize for that.
And some of them can come out safely, apologize for what they've done, but they never apologize for what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel disappointed, but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet, you have to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but you're not.
Thank you, Boulder . Enjoy the candle.
Intelligence, what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has been seen, a productive example has been the famous quote of Chris Diplomas that``The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim . ''
When Design Dickinson wrote this, he did this as a critic to the computer pioneers like Alan Turing.
And so a few years ago, I started a program to try and understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's relax a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're an alien race, that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the Earth intelligence, but you have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and you have incredibly long lives, so you can look at Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as terrorists, we know that the reason that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on Earth intelligence, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that will explain how, to a certain time, the asteroids that are demolished the surface of a planet, they stop doing it.
And so I'm sorry that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I took several years ago, I analyzed a variety of subjects through science, through several disciplines, that they were, I, I, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In cosmology, for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be ultimately adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in robotic motion planning, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the robots of the robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different issues and putting them together, I asked, from a few years ago: Is there a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different issues?
Is there just an equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is yes . What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = for the intelligence that I've seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or maintain open options, with a force T, with the diversity of possible future, yes, to an impending future time.
In few words, intelligence doesn't like to stay trapped.
intelligence tries to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain open options.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How predictable is it?
Do you predict the level of human intelligence?
You predict artificial intelligence?
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: Recent research in cosmology has suggested that the universes that produce more messy, or entropy, for their life should have trend to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that underlying cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence is a deeper relationship?
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of long-term entropy production, but actually comes directly from it?
To find out, we developed a software engine called Power, designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy production in any system where it's inside.
Amazingly, entropy could pass multiple animal intelligence evidence, play games of human intelligence, and even make money trading actions, all of them without being asked to do that.
Here are some examples of entropy in action.
Just like a foot human without falling, here we see English balancing a post using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Portrait a goal.
It just decided for his account to balance the post.
This balance of balance will have applications for human robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools of tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate by pulling out of the opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that entropy can make a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
So entropy is widely applicable to a variety of domains.
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game game against itself, illuminating its potential for play.
So here we see England to orchestra new connections in a social network where friends are constantly disconnected and keeps successful the network connected.
This same network of networks also have applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see Portrait organizing the routes of a ship fleet, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, entropy is widely applicable to problems in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see English spontaneously to discover and run a strategy of compressed, very self-confident in a simulation of actions of actions, successfully increasing assets under its exponentially management.
This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance.
Alex Wisnord: What you've seen is that a variety of brands of smart cognitive behaviors like the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep irony.
So let's go back at the beginning of the use of the robot, the``Ross"work; there was always the concept that if we developed smart machines, there would be a cyber rebellion.
The machines will get up against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe every decade, we've had the whole concept of cyber rebellion to reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then megaborials, and they try to get out of the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse of taking control of all the future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control, rather than the reverse.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the goal.
I often ask you,``How do you look for goals from this kind of framework? ''
My equivalent to that statement to help the descendants to help us build artificial intelligence, or to help us understand human intelligence, is the following: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a point of inflection in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet that we call home.
Although, in the last few years, we have just expanded our knowledge of how Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The NASA Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting around other stars, which points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the dim intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that comes up with us.
The data collected by Kepler show the size of the planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their mother star.
Now, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and rocky as planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their Sun.
Instead, this gives you clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we're finding this treasure of potentially habitable worlds, our own planet is falling under the weight of humanity.
2014 was the hottest record.
Glacier and sea ice that have been with us from millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on global scale have rapidly overcome our ability to alter their course.
But I I'm not a weather scientist, no astronomer.
I study the ability of the planet influenced by stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say it's looking for alien opportunities in the immune sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search of life in the universe, I can tell you that the more you look for planets similar to Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invited a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know better: our solar system.
Take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and rocks, and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated this for a mission like the Kepler.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our Rovers like``Curiosity"tracking its surface in search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that orbit, like the MBA mission, take samples of the Martian atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose its ability.
private companies now offer not only short space flights, but also the temptation of living in Mars.
But even though all these Martian images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the vanishes and paradigm ideas, compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the desert areas of our planet that still remain for colonization, really extractive places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and most elevated places on Earth, the air is fresh and full of oxygen shown by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for Mars's colonization and other planets have got a big, sad shadow: the implications and belief of some Mars to wait there to save us from this influential self-destructive of the only planet that we know is truly habitable, Earth.
For much, I like the interplanetary exploration, I'm deep deep with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to save humanity, it's like imagining that the Titanic captain will tell you that the truth of truth will have place later in wild boats . Thank you.
But the goals for interplanetary exploration and land preservation doesn't be controlled.
No, they're actually faces of the same coin: the goal to understand, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world as alien channels.
You just find it closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces, in the hostile and hot areas of Earth, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment: Fermi paradox.
A lot of years ago, the physicist of Enrico Fermi asked: realizing that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there are a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life existence until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become terribly advanced enough to consider to continue to live between stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that drive this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the interplanetary colonization will save ourselves from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and the interplanetary exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to support the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve the Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I jumped my own house.
And while I was in the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window they were at the table table, where I had left them.
So quickly, I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all fine.
I thought about calling a pig, at least I had my cell phone, but in the midnight, a pig could take a long time to get, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I was missing my passport and my suitcase.
It would be expensive, but I'm sure not more expensive than a stream in the middle of a night, so I thought, that despite the circumstances, it was okay stop.
I'm a professor neuroscientist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
Corrupt Liberia that increases heart rate, modulate levels and cloud levels.
And when I got to the manufacturing counter in the airport, I realized I had no passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to wonder, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in its place, that prevent bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, that minimize the probability of being a total catastrophe.
So I got to think about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't have a critic.
I was dinner with my colleague Danny Kanzahahahahahahakaah, the Nobel Prize winner, and a little embarrassed, he told him that he broke the window, and he had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he had been practicing something called prospective feedback.
It's something he had learned from psychologist Gary Klein, who had written from this a few years before, known as the promise.
You all know what the posture is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and trying to figure out what came wrong, right?
In the printer, as Danny explains, you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might be wrong, and then try to figure out what can do to prevent things happen or minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some of the things that we can do in the form of a temperature.
Some of them are evident, others are not so obvious.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, it will deploy a place for things that are lost easily.
This sounds common sense, but there's a lot of science that supports this thesis, based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of important things, where it's the good, where the fish are, that causes fruit trees, where they live the friendships and enemies.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is added in London's taxi.
It's the part of the brain that allows the squirrel to find their nuts.
And if someone really asked if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the smell of the squirrel, and yet they could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing car keys, reading glasses and passports.
So at home they get a place for keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a decorative dish.
For its passport, a particular crate.
For their reading glasses, a particular teacher.
If you take a place and you're exploration with it, your things will always be there when you look for them.
What about travel?
You take the cell phone a picture of your credit card, you're planning to drive, passion, send it by email to yourself so you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or steal, this can facilitate substitution.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
Corruption is toxic and interpretation.
So part of the early practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical attention or a loved self, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is called a prostate for all medical decisions, and in fact for financial decision-making and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from a rational assessment of facts.
So let's suppose they go to the doctor, and the doctor says,``I've gotten the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little high . ''
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, attack to heart, brain spill.
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says,``I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the cholesterol, a statue . ''
And perhaps you've heard about the statistics, and you know that it's one of the most recycled drugs in the world today . You're probably likely to know people who take them.
So, you think,``Yes, I read the statue! ''
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for most physicians don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the NIH, the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the NIH?
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or deliver a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you should think about what kind of standard statistician is that?
The number must be one.
My doctor wasn't going to be able to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor's fault, and if it's somebody's fault, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood underlying mechanisms.
But the Schooling estimates that 90 percent of drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely prescribed strategy, what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This according to the research of the cynical researchers Jeremy Group and Pamela Harvard, confirmed independently by Bloomberg.
I just explore numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, brain spill or another adverse event.
Now, you may think,``Well, one chance in 300 of down my cholesterol.
Why not, doctor? Untie the recipe anyway . ''
But then you should be asked by a more statistics, and it's,``Hem from the side effects ."Yes?
For this particular drug, side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include terrible things: debilitating muscle pain and articulate pain, passionate pain, but now they think,``The five percent is not really likely that it happens to me, still take medicine . ''
But a moment.
Remember under stress, they don't think of clarity.
So you think about how you're going to do this over time, so you don't have to make the reasoning chain in the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has helped, five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get harmed by the drug that you can help your drug.
I don't say they should or not take the status.
I just say they should have this conversation with their doctor.
Medical ethics requires it, it's part of the informed consent principle.
We have a right to access this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
You're probably thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary is pretty typical.
For the surgery that you're doing in the older men of 50, extensive from prostate per cancer, the number necessary to treat is 49.
So , 49 surgeries for a person who has helped.
And side effects in that case, they occur in 50 percent of patients.
Those include impact or erectile dysfunction, urinary incidence, recycled landscape, fecal incentives.
And if you're lucky, it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just last one year or two.
So the idea of the promise is to think about time, the questions that you can pose to drive the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this in the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life free, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change opinion in the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases under stress, and one of the things that happens at that time is that a lot of systems came off.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
I face face with a predator, it's not necessary the digestive system, or the rain or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism in those things, it doesn't react fast . They could become the lunch of lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress is rational logical thinking, like Danny Kanzahahaha and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to train us to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all flawed.
We're all going to fail when.
The idea is to think about the future how those failures might be, to put the systems in the place that will help you minimize harm, or to prevent that bad things happen in the first place.
Redistribution at the snow night in Monterey, when I came back from my journey, my contractor inspired me a combination of combination next to the door, with a key door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters I haven't ordered, and lots of emails I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a gradual process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: piano,``P"is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing softly.
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a``P"in the score, you need to play more gently.
Two .', even more soft.
Four .'"-- extremely soft.
This is my drawing of a tree tree, and there you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of a P P, you can never get to a whole silence.
That's my current definition of silence: a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system system, the AIMS, besides a little bit of my own story.
The French signs language came down during the 1800s, and over time, it mixed with local signs, and the language is developed that we know today as AIMS.
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born deaf . And I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, now I realize that it's not true for anything.
Sound are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a deaf person who lives in a world of sounds, it's like I live in an foreign country, following blindly their rules, complete, behaviors and rules without questioning.
So how do I understand sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my loudspeakers and amplify sound.
I learn and copy that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people respond.
So I've learned, for example ...
\" Don't hold the door! ''
\" Don't make a lot of noise to eating the bag of potato fries! ''
\" Not wrong ,"and when you're eating, you're sure not to scratch the covers in the dish . ''
All of this I call it``sound tag . ''
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm super surgeone of sounds.
And I'm always waiting with neurologists that sound, what it's about to come next.
Hence, this drawing.
TEDx, to decide.
TBC, to continue.
TB, to announce.
You can see that the picture doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines are already sound across the subtle and manipulative delete.
In the deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for``penilography"in the AIMS.
A typical picture has five lines.
However, to me, to do this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had a chance to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic resistance there.
Before this time, I had worked as a painter.
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different galleries, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, sound was the trend, and that called me.
There was no visual art, it was all auditory.
Now the sound has entered my art territory.
Is art going to tell me more of art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like that.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well, it's not only experienced through ears.
I can feel it technically, or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property property and integrate it in my artistic practice.
And everything they had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and unveil it.
I began to create a new job body.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, it was impressed with the amount of support and attention I received.
I realized that sound is like money, power, control: social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was an alien, it was something from an listener person.
And the sound is so powerful that well could be defined to me and my artistic work, or I could be empowered.
I chose that I would be empowered.
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to society eyes is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like the same and become my voice.
That way I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, at work and institutions, work with many different performers from AIMS.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be heard.
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask to borrow your voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I wouldn't continue to continue this practice, I feel that it could fade down in oblivion and not have any kind of social value.
So, with sound as my new artistic medium, deep in the music world.
And I'm surprised by seeing the similarities between music and AIMS.
For example, a musical note can't capture and express on the paper.
And the same thing can tell you about a concept in AIMS.
The two are very space and highly modular, which means subtle changes can affect the whole meaning as much as the sounds.
I'd like to share you with a piano metaphor, so you understand better how AIMS works.
So, imagine a piano.
The AIMS is divided in many different rational parameters.
If you assign a different parameter for every finger while you touch the piano, like the facial expression, the body's movement, the speed, the shape of your body, the speed, the shape of your hand, and so, while you touch the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you're just going to get one key at
However, the AIMS is more like a chord, you need 10 fingers in a simultaneous way to express a clear concept or idea in AIMS.
If just a keyboard would change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of tone, timbre and volume.
In AIMS, when you use these different rational parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the``fifth of that . ''
This is the``feedback in that . ''
I'm seeing you.
Look at it.
Oh, I got married.
Ooh.
What are you looking at?
Ah, enough!
So I got to think, and if I look at AIMS through the lens of music?
If I had to create a sign and repeat it again and again, it could become as a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of``day ,"the sun comes out and put it.
This is``all day . ''
If you repeat it and reduce the speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can say from``all night . ''
\" All night . ''
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to thinking about about three different days,``night ,"`` overnight ,"`` all night . ''
I feel that the third has more music than the other two.
This represents the time in AIMS, and how the distance to the body can express changes over time.
For example, one -- it's one hand, two stories . It's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is in the back.
So the first example is,``It's a long time ago . ''
Then,``past ."`` Use to ,"and the last, which is my favorite, very romantic, dramatic idea at once,``There was once . ''
\" Common time"is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times per capita.
However, when I see the word``common time"I think automatically in``at the same time . ''
See MIT: Right hand, E -- left hand.
We have the penicillin through the head and the chest.
[ Face] [Face] [Face] [unclear] [[ [[ [: E, the soft card -- I'm going to show you a form of my hand called``flashing paw . ''
Can you do it with me?
All of them with the hands.
Now we're going to do it so much in your head and your chest, something like``common time"or``at the same time . ''
Yeah, very well.
That means``love"in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this . Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means``colonization"in the AIMS.
Now, the third . Please take me again.
And again.
It's``lighting"in the AIMS.
We're going to do the three together.
\" Look at ,"`` colonization ,"and``lighting . ''
Good job all.
Notice how the three signs are very similar . They all happen in your head and your chest, but you transmit very different meanings.
It's incredible to see how the AIMS is alive and prosperous, just like music.
However, today, we live in a very authentic world.
And only because the AIMS has no sounds, automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start to question what the social value defines and allow the AIMS to develop its own value, without sound.
And this could be a step to make a society more inclusive.
And perhaps people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn AIMS, not to hear to learn music.
The AIMS is a rich treasure, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, you can even love us.
Thank you.
Denise Kalibanda: Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said,``You can teach it all, but then you have to clean it up . ''
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence bubble or an ignorance bubble, because adults lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
By making me older, I learned that adults also teach and that they're not very good to clean the other ones.
Time happened, now I'm an adult and I teach citizen and invention at Hong Kong's school.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we clean the beaches, and not, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you're, I I I didn't know.
It's sad to say, but today over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, collecting those plastic chunks to study them under the microscope, and we classify them and we collected this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive, and it's also very risky to use those enormous boats.
So together with my students, with ages of six to 15, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this work of work with height, so that the very low kids can also participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools are great and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to the plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its fragmentation.
That's what we do.
I leave the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to combine them into something we hope that works.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, we just collect information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this plastic -- kids are very excited about robots.
And then we created quickly what we call a prototype.
We are so quick in creating prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we transformed light bulbs and web cameras in access, and we assemble it in a floating robot that will slowly move through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor as the computer of the board will process this image and measure the size of each particle, to get an approximate estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We document this step-by-step invention on a website for inventors called``Instruction ,"with the hope that someone's best even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they're trying to solve it immediately.
[ I can investigate my local problem"] But my students in Hong Kong are very good kids.
You see the news, you've got the Internet, and you hit this image.
A child, perhaps less than 10 years old, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands, in Sandellands, the largest mangroves in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water they drink, it's the water in which they bathe, the water where they live, the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and oil also are brown, and when everything is mixed, it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called spectrum, which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a spectrum that can vibrate through all kinds of substances that produce different species, which can help to identify what's in the water.
We wrote this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
What's great about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
[ I can research a problem .] I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm the Japanese and half French, and you may remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that they trigger several giant waves, called tsunami, and those tsunami destroyed several cities on the east coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear central close to water.
And today, according to the reports, an average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has pollution traces by Cambridge.
If we go to the west coast, we can measure Fukushima radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of them, in time, is safe, is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to Fukushima every year from the accident and research in an independent way with other scientists, land, river, and this time we wanted to take kids.
Of course we didn't take them, the parents didn't allow them.
But every night we reported the control center -- here you see the use of different masks.
It might seem like they didn't take the job seriously, but they did do it because they're going to have to live with their life.
Together with them we discussed the data collected that day and talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the international, etc.
And to do this, we created a rudimentary telecommunication map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the elevation map, we introduced pigments to represent data in real time of radio, and we collect water to simulate the rain.
With this, we were able to notice that the radioactive dust was leaking from the top of the mountain to the river system and it was in the ocean.
It was an approximate estimate.
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear to date.
We zoom up to 1,000 miles from the nuclear central, and with the help of fishermen in the area, we were collecting seas from the sea bed with a sediments tracking as we invented and built.
Here we see a progression: we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple codes.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became so small, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong, and we converted it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong, and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optics, basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where children's dreams can actually become true with adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: acceleration! acceleration!
Casag Harvard: We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or can we help in the mobility of advanced age population transforming their standard wheelchair in new electrical vehicles?
Plastic, oil and radioactivity are terrible legacy, but the worst legacy that we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent solutions.
So scientific citizens, creators, dreamer, we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two twin domes, two radically opposite design cultures.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a single silk thread.
One of them is synthetic, the other organic.
One of the things you can do is you impose the environment, you create it.
One is designed by nature, one for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the marble in gross, he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The movie was only a tool from Michelangelo.
But living beings are not bound.
They grow.
And in the smaller units of life, cells, we take all the information that's required by every cell to work and to replicate.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by risks of manufacturing and production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of parts, reaching the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as an anticipation of discrete parts with different functions.
But you don't find a human material assembly in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with dialogued pores.
The skin on the back are more thick with little pores.
You act primarily as a filter, the other mostly as a barrier, and yet it's the same skin: there's no parts, there's no ants.
It's a system that will gradually vary its functionality through the variation variation.
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the divided world, the double personality of every designer and architect to work today between the movie and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthesis, shows on the two screens behind me.
My job, in his simplest level, tries to unite these two visions of the world, leaving the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years ago?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they make four disciplines that offers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I created.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools through scales, large scale, like this robotic arm with a about 24 meters of diameter with a very distant day that some day not very far very distant buildings print entire buildings, and graphs to nanoscale facts of genetically modified microbes that shine in the darkness.
Here we've reinvented the cellulose, an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where each open is unique to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a skirt . This was for a fashion parade in Paris with Iran, and it's like a second skin made from one piece, ridiculographed in the contours, flexible around the waist.
With 3D printing collaborator, we printed this layer and free 3D skirt with no seams between cells . I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combined rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 microns.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a CD scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and synthetic instruments, allowed to design products that adapt not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at the small time, comfortable, and also absorb sound.
Professor Carter, my collaborator, we went back to nature to inspire, and by designing this irregular surface pattern, it becomes sub-Saharan.
We printed this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in stiffness, equity and color, correspond to pressure points in the human body.
Your surface, as in nature, is worth your functionality not through the addiction of another material or another assembly, but you're continuously varied and deliberately material property.
But is it ideal nature?
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Hebrew Bible, and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what matters me.
Like she's related,``In the third day of creation, God sent the Earth to grow a fresh fruit tree . ''
For that first fruit tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and fruits.
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, crust, stores and flowers.
The land created a world made from parts.
I often wonder,``What would design be if objects made a single piece?
Will we go back to a better state of creation? ''
So we find that the biblical material, the kind of fruit tree material with fruits, and we find it.
The second most abundant biography on the planet is called a announcement, and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, costs and butterflies.
We thought if we could synthesize their properties, we could generate multi-touch structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal seafood . We've got a lot of shrimp husks, and we put them out and we produced character.
You can see chemical concentrations, we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and opaque, light, soft and transparent.
In order to print the large-scale structures, a system was built with multiple nozzles of extractive controlled extraction.
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one three feet long material , 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, they let them dry up to find a natural form to the contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with plastic?
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain physical microorganisms that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we built the bacteria designed genetically to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of vehicle, and if you expand even more, to windows.
A fresh fruit tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for observation designed objects, put in the sea, feed the marine life, and put in the ground, help grow a tree.
The adjust for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility to create clothes to keep life for interplanetary travel.
To do that, we have to dominate the bacteria and control its flow.
Just like the periodic table, we made our own elements of elements: new forms of life created automatically, manufactured in an additive form and increased biological form.
I like to think about synthetic biology as liquid alchemy, only instead of going to the precious metals, they synthesized new biological functionality within very small channels.
This field is called microbe.
We printed our own 3D channels to control the flow of these liquid bacterial crops.
In our first piece of clothing, two microorganisms combined.
The first one is cyber.
It lives in our oceans and in the freshwater ponds.
And the second, E. coli, the bacteria that lies in the human intestine.
One turn light in sugar, the other sugar consumption and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms do not interact in nature.
In fact, they never met.
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothing.
Think of it as evolution, not for natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that goes into digestive tract, to help them flow these bacteria and to alter their way.
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, including the properties of the material according to the desired functionality.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, we were designing more transparent channels.
This portable digestive system, when you stretch one end to another, it took 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our thin intestine.
And here it is, as a principal at TED, our first portable photosynthesis, brilliant lineage channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary Shelley said,``We're a fashion past creatures, only half is made . ''
What if design would provide the other half?
What if we could create structures that increase life?
What if we could create personal microbes that dig our skin, repair the damaged tissue and hold our bodies?
Think about this as a way to edit biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer printed material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it.
It grows . adds with sophistication.
This worm of the worm, for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which it's memorized.
Now, no additive manufacturing is about this level of sophistication.
It does it by combination not of two materials, but two proteins in different concentrations.
An act as a structure, the other is glue or matrix, bringing those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first is used in the environment, creates a tension structure, and then it starts to thread a cocoon of compression.
tension and compression, the two forces of life, manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we paste a small magnet to the head of a silk worm, to the spinneret.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat patch, not within a box, we realized that it's a flat cocoon, and still metaphorical.
So we started designing different environments, different scaffolding, and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the cocoon structure, is transmitted directly by the environment.
The silk worms are often boil up to death within their cocoons, their silk gets rid and used in the textile industry.
We saw that designing these templates we could shape the raw silk without boiling a single cocoon.
We were safely memorized, and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to architectural scale.
We had a hip robot making silk templates, and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms migrate into more dark and cold areas, so we used a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or openings, to block the rays of light and heat, distributed silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the caterpillars.
We asked 1,500 silk worms to an online farm farm.
And after we feed four weeks, they were ready to thread with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the scaffolding, and as they were striking, they were crazy, they mate, they were approved, they put eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much shorter.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
At the high biological silk of the silk silk, it's robotic silk, and they give all of this pavilion their integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, six silk worms weave 65 miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The cops, after the season, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra panels in the future.
So here are the two visions in the world.
A silk chair through a robotic arm, the other empty film.
If the last frontier frontier is giving the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers have to bring together these two visions in the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from an inspired design in nature to an inspired nature in design, which demands from us, for the first time, that we make us charge.
Thank you.
Thank you very much . Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered,``What do you want to be? ''
If you had to remember what age you had when you first asked them for the first time?
You can show it with your fingers.
Three . Five . Three . Five . Five . Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question,``What do you want to be more? ''
It's caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question,``What do you want to be? ''
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had too much.
In school, I liked English, the killing and the art and developed websites . Furthermore, I played the guitar in a public band called Telephony frustrated.
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to try and persist anyway, because I've spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of boredom, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to me.
And I have to leave it.
But then I'm interested in something else, something completely different, and I dive into it, and I'm going to let myself absorb, and I'm like,``Yes! I've found my own ,"and then again, this point where I start to bored.
And finally, I want to leave it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all my other passions, and I would resist.
Another reason why I caused so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong in this, and something wrong in me because I wasn't defined by anything.
I worried to be afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or automatic or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked you then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they learned it: they learned from culture.
We're asked first,``What do you want to be more? ''
We're about five years old.
And the truth is that nobody cares what you're telling that age.
It's considered an naive question to provide nice answers in kids like,``Be an astronaut ,"or``be dancers"or``I want to be pirated . ''
You're going to insert the Delah's disability here.
This question is done over and over again, and again, as we grow up in different ways, stop, to high school students, you're asked to choose in college.
And at some point,``What do you want to be? ''
It's going to be the cute exercise of before what sleep takes us.
Why?
While this question inspired children to dream with what they might be, not inspired with everything they could be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, although you're good adults, you might be laughing and say,``Oh, what nice, but you can't be craftsmen of violent and psychologist.
You have to choose . ''
This is Dr. Bob Children, and he's an artist of rape and psychopath.
And this Amy Niger, a magazine publisher converted into illusion, business, teacher and creative director.
But most children don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of central life is very idealized in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real vocation, the idea that each of us has something that's going to spend for their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who's not connected in this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel just.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel that there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a multiplicity.
A multinational is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a box like that.
It could help if you divide in three parts: multiple, potential and day.
You can also use other terms that you can use the same idea, as a scholar, Renaissance.
During the time of Renaissance, the ideal was who I was right in multiple disciplines.
Barbara Shah refers to us as``scanners . ''
You use any term you like or invent your own.
It seems like a species of adapting to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to look at furniture as limited or ability to beat.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website is that there are huge strengths to be like this.
Here are three multinational superpowers here.
One: ideas synthesis.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new in the intersection.
Mr. Hannane and Rachel Bionics expressed their interests shared in cartography, data visualization, travel, mathematics and design, by founding Mexico.
Mest is a company that creates geographically inspired jewelry.
So, Mr. and Rachel came up with this unique idea for its mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens in intersections.
That's where new ideas come from.
And the crowds, with all their ancestors, can access a lot of these intersection points.
The second multinational superpower is fast learning.
When the crowds are interested by something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being beginners, for having been many times in the past, and this means we have less fear of testing new things and coming out of our comfort zones.
A lot of skills are transfer to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area that we're chasing, so we rarely start from zero.
Now, nodes Don is a full-time journey and independent writing.
As a pianist girl, they perfected an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest mechanism known.
Before becoming writer, I was a financial planners.
He had to learn the ultimate sales mechanics when he started his practices, and this ability helps to write compelling ingredients for publishers.
Rarely it's a loss of time to dedicate what you're attracted to, even if you end it up.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have foreseen.
The third multi-touch superpower is adaptability . That is, the ability to transform into anything you need in a given situation.
Abe Captain is sometimes director of videos, others, web pages, sometimes consultant times of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes apparently James Bond.
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because he can take diverse roles, depending on the needs of his clients.
The Fab Company Magazine defined adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and unpredictable that they are the individuals and organizations that can bite to satisfy the needs of the market, the ones that really will thrive.
Ideas of ideas, quick learning and adaptability: three skills where the multinationals are very adept, and three skills that could be lost if they're ready to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest to foster multiple people to be themselves.
We have complex problems, multiple right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in their heart, specialists.
They came out of the belly knowing they wanted to be pediatric neurosurgeons.
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you either.
In fact, some of the best teams are being made from a specialist and a multinational employees.
The specialist can dive deep in depth and put in practice ideas, and the crowd offers an amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to arise with the way we're connected.
And unfortunately, the crowds in large part are encouraged to simply be more like their specialized partners.
And once I said this, if there's one thing you're taking from this talk, I hope it's this: Reconstruct with the inner wiring, whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist, then, especially for all media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the crowds in the room, including those who just realized to be one of them in the last 12 minutes, I tell you,``Recover with their many passions . ''
They follow their curiosity by those rabbits.
explore intersections.
embracing our internal wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, multinational, the world needs us!
Thank you.
In 1991, a woman called Australia took it to a psychiatric in Jerusalem.
He was delivered, and he couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called Allens.
He didn't know how to help Audience, but he would go through her until, unfortunately, he passed in 1906.
After his death, Alaska did an autopsy, and they found strange plates and events in the brain of Australia, a guy that they had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If I had been alive today, we couldn't give it to her more help than the one that Alaska gave him 125 years ago.
Alliance was Dr. Allies Alzheimer.
And Autopt Deterries, the first patient in getting a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 1991, medicine has advanced a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infection, many treatments for cancer, anti-particular treatments for HIV, statistics for the cardiac and much more.
But recently, it's been progress in the Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's access over a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, include many of you.
If you wait to live until the age of 85 or more, the possibility of contracting Alzheimer's going to be almost one in two.
In other words, there's the probability that they spend their launder years with Alzheimer or helping care to a friend or be loved with Alzheimer's.
In the United States, the Alzheimer's careful costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease, and its costs are going to prevent a five times in the year 2050, as it prevents the generation of the baby.
You may surprise them, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it has done relatively little to fight it.
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's the only one that can't prevent or cure or even slow its development.
We understand less from Alzheimer than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more the Alzheimer's and causes a similar annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause: the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what few people know, but everybody should: Alzheimer's a disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 125 years, everybody, even scientists, confuse Alzheimer's aging.
We think that it will become responsive in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only just looking at a picture of a healthy aging brain in comparison with a patient in Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to decline a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage of the brain caused by Alzheimer's life expectancy, and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer found plates and weird sheep in the Bush's brain a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they are made of protein molecules.
You can think a molecule molecule like a piece of paper that folds like an origami.
There are places on the paper that are sticky.
And when it folds well, these sticky dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky dots stay outside.
And this makes the protein molecules get together, forming groups that can form big plates and sheep.
That's what we see in the patient's brain with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this dysfunction works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what happens to block is complex, like deforming a bomb.
Curing a wire could do nothing.
You can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that blocks it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of them have reduced the wires and waiting for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, geneticists, chemicals, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process, and now you're testing a new kind of drugs that are specifically blocking this step to stop disease.
So let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened by testing these worms in worms.
These are the healthy worms, and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms, on the other hand, have protein molecules that paste each other inside them, like in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they are clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see they heal and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After 115 years of waiting, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to realize that Alzheimer's is a disease, and if we try, we can see it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and families have taken more research and exercise pressure about governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and legislators.
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, hidden victims, care of their loved ones day and night, are often too eager to come out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not, in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like Australia, who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They help talking for them, and they help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York Times column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To love someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience by testing it myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers are used to make 36 more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of examples of example.
Number 12: If you could wake tomorrow tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would it be?
Number 28: When was the last time you cried before another person?
And only?
As you move forward, these are increasingly personal.
Number 30: I like this -- I love your partner, what you're like from him or she's very honest this time, and I did things that you wouldn't say anyone you've ever known.
When I stumbled on this study a few years ago, a detail really called me the attention, the chimpanzee that two of the participants had spent six months later and invited everything from the lab to the ceremony.
So, it was skeptical about this process of making romantic love, but, of course, I was also intrigued.
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone I knew didn't particularly very well, I didn't expect to love.
However, we fall in love, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the Ludla column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already August, so I guess some of you probably wonder: Do you keep together still?
And the reason I think you're questioning this is because I've been asked by this question over and over in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was published, the article was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so, I had been used to writing about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entry can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my friends of Facebook and imagine that my article in the New York Times would probably achieve a thousands of views.
And that's a good deal of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as he gave it, he had no idea.
The article published on a Friday at night, and already Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And Sunday, I had already called me the Star Montalog and the Good America.
In one month, the article received over eight million visits, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with sincerity about open-source experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news, and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call up or write, what they did every day for weeks, always, they asked the same question: Do they still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase,``You still follow together? ''
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and journalists like this.
I was interviewed in the radio and asked it.
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed up to the stage,``Hey Mandela where is your boyfriend? ''
And I immediately put me red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the answer of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have spent life itself.
In fact, the New York Times published a complementary article for San Valenti, who included the experiences of the readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse for all of this attention was to be very reserved with my own relationship.
I said no to every request that we both would make a public emergence together.
I took up television interviews, and I returned the orders of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the inappropriate icons of the training process, a range for which I didn't feel in the absolute grade.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really worked: or whether it was able to produce enduring love, not just an adventure, but real love, enduring love.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship had just a few months, and I felt, especially, that people would pose the wrong question.
How do you know whether we're going to go together or not, and to say it?
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of making these 36 less interesting questions?
Dr. Arthur Aron wrote first about these questions in the same study in 1997, and there, the goal of the research was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for to foster interpersonal approach between college students, using what Aaron called the personal openness, progressive and reciprocal.
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer after doing that . Several later studies also used the Arabic Republican protocol of Aron as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of police and community, and they've used it among people of opposing political ideologies.
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, who combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was quoted in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little university of liberal arts, and then a student came up to me and told me with shyness: I tried the study and didn't work.
He seemed puzzling for it.
And I: Do you mean that you fall in love with the person with who you did?
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but became better friends?
Did you feel that you did know better after testing the study?
The seat.
So, it worked ,"I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled with the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since I was 20, which was practically supposed to all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and he had no idea how or he could live without him.
So I flew in science.
And I investigate everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could somehow be vaccinated the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought that I just researched for the book that I wrote, but in retrospect, it seems really obvious.
I thought that if I was bored with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and alone as I felt then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in a way or another.
I'm more patient with love . I I'm more relaxed.
I have more confidence to demand what I'm looking for.
But I can also see you more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than what reasonably can tell me.
What's looking for love is a guarantee, not only to be loved today and being loved tomorrow, but I'll keep being loved indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to love.
There can be a way to somehow mitigate something from the implicit risk, and this is a very attractive story, because we're going to get to feel wonderfully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that you ask: still continue together?
And his content with an answer of whether or not.
So more than a question, I would propose that asking harder questions, questions like: How do you decide who you deserve your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things complicated, and how to know when to cut and distance?
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your partner?
I don't know necessarily answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more reflective conversation about what it means love to love.
So, if you want the brief version of the story of my relationship, it's this -- a year ago, a known, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we fall in love, we still follow together, and I'm very happy.
But to love is not the same as staying in love.
Let's love the easy part.
So at the end of my article, I wrote: Love didn't happen.
Let's fall in love because we took the choice of being.
And I became a little bit about reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that I knew that choice.
I wouldn't consider how many times we would have to make that decision, and how much times I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he's always choosing or not.
I want you to be done enough and answer 36 questions, I've chosen to love somebody so generous, nice and fun and expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think.
And what I look for, and what I might spend, my life is that that myth is true.
I want the final happy ending in the title of my article, which is, , by the way, the only part of the article I didn't actually write.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he will also love me, and it's terrifying, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few legislators in a mountain, and in a way, I came up as a geometry of the forest.
New York City does a while ago, which really affected me, but more details ahead.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box, and I learned a dollar bill, a feather and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange humans or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example, how we eat spaghetti.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's because here I am , 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a time, I was in Hawaii -- I like to go out of surgery and make sure and all those weird things -- and I was making a colleague for my mother.
And I took a dictionary, and I took away all the pages and I made a kind of called called the Agnes Martin style, the resin covered and a bee was trapped.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's allergic to them, so I added more resin in the canvas, thinking I could hide it.
Instead, the opposite happened: somehow it seemed that it took up size, as if you would look at the text with a magnifying light.
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I was finding down the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate to them and tell stories about these objects.
So I went to draw around objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow up, draw the same as it does around a card on the scene of the crime.
And I took the objects and I created my own temple of specimens invented.
First, botanical -- that you can make an idea.
Then I did some strange insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the resin layers.
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend to dinner, for example, go to Symbrood.
It was great, man.
At some point I was interested in the human form, natural size sculptures with the drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was dead.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the glass layers, similar to the drawing in a window, then in another window, and another window, and had all these windows together that formed three-dimensional composition.
And this really worked, and I could stop using the resin.
So I did this for years, and my work was a very big piece, which I call``traffic . ''
For``Traffic"I'm largely inspired in``The Garden of Delar Delaws"which is a painting at the meadow Museum in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, the traffic . I'll explain this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Five meters long.
It has double expensive, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, there's Jesus and the maggots.
There's a cave where all these children with the heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the performance world, to this analog mesh underworld where they hide.
This is where the heads with the heads of animals are headed in the face, ready to suicide in mass running in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to an acronym.
Billy Graham is in the sea; the horizon -- the oil platform of the Wall Bertha, the refugee of Osama Bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of a woman.
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits oil in a hand while the other hand comes up clouds.
Your hands are like weapons and it looks like a mythology that keeps the Earth and the cosmos.
So it's an aspect of the traffic.
It's a little bit a narrative.
That's the hand that I spit.
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a nose, like a bird of bird, and you spit clouds from this trap.
It also has a five meters long, a snake tail that joins the traffic.
Anyway, their tail is fire by putting on a volcano.
I don't know why it happened.
Things that happen, you know.
His tail ends up in a nuclear climate balloon made from terrorist cards from 1986.
Have you seen them?
They were done in the 1980, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very ahead of time . This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects: One's called``psychologists . ''
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material being encyclopedias, dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in ways of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they come together, divide.
And you can walk between them . It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a microscope player that weighs 1,000 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's your head; it's the chest, you can get into the entrance.
I'm going to join you for the rest of the body: there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or no knowledge, or whatever it has, a kind of angry thing.
It's a quick repair of these works because I can't tell you for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a party in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that go out and go into the head of this strange statue.
There's a little forest scene inside the tropical cavity.
Can you see it?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box . It's called Portal Worlds.
Within this box, there's a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a radio emitter, a museum, a school, an editorial arm that spread all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
We measure the box and all the people in the middle with each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you regenerate who you are and the box you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same material and the same box.
And if we don't start trading those things with sweetness, and we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take an aspirin.
But for this pill to have an effect against pain, first through the stomach, the intestines and other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective, most effective system, so that any of the drugs will be effective in the body.
The disadvantage, though, is that when you swallow any drug, it's dilute.
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take antiretroviral drugs, these serve to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the CDC.
But they're also known for their adverse side effects, mostly negative, because in the time they take to get to the blood current, they dilate, and worse for the time they take to get to their destination, which is more important, in the HIV department.
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is innocent, and it doesn't easily enter the blood tower of patients who join the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new blood cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a lifelong treatment for life.
So one day, I sat down and I thought,``Could we make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of medicine of drugs? ''
As a scientific expert in lasers, the answer was in front of me: lasers, of course.
If you use it in dentistry, for the care of wounds and diabetes, you can be used for anything imaginable, including the intrinsic transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser piles to open or drill extremely small holes, which open and close immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best question is,``How is that possible? ''
We send a little, powerful laser ray on the cellular membrane of HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize, the hole is immediately repaired.
We're currently testing this technology in vitro or on petri plates, but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
\" How is that possible?"You can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a three-dimensional device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make an incentive on the infection site.
The second head, which is a camera, is headed to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, an injection that distributed the drug, releases it directly on the site of infection, while the laser is used again to maintain open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem much about time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV from the body.
Yeah . A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all HIV researchers -- in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I I've been studying armed armed groups: armed organizations like terrorists, insults or militia.
I document what these groups do when they're not shooting.
My goal is to understand the better of these general violence agents and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation to nonviolent confrontation.
I do field work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
No.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-government actors.
For example, from the 216 acres of peace signed between 1975 and 2011 , 1960 was signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we should understand these groups; we have even to engage or defeat them in any process of successful conflicts.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know the reasons why they fight, how they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't fight.
The armed struggle and political policies are related.
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less to defeat them, without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the Henry limited, known for their violent cooling against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980, Heinstern has also established a political party, a network of social services and military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Halla, known for its suicide attacks against Israel, also manage the Gaza Strip since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multitasking.
They set a complex machinery of communication: radio stations, TV channels, websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the ISIS magazine, printed in English and published to recruit.
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising of non-profits, but through profitable businesses, for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they build hospitals, they put up professional training programs or microbes.
Heighousan offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population offering something that the state doesn't provide: security and protection.
The ascent of Taliban in an Afghanistan ravaged by war or even the beginning of the ISIS ascent, it can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an incredibly elevated price for the population.
But generally, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a gap left by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 in Palestinian Hama cannot understand without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at armed groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid.
They grow up because they fill gaps left by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations are these organizations, we can categorize them as something opposite to a state.
How do I call a group like Heijarde?
They mastered part of a territory, they manage all their functions, collect the trash, manage the sewer system.
Is it a state? Is it a rebel group?
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is ISIS?
The lines are drawn.
We live in a world of states, with no state and hybrids, and the weaker the states are, like in the Middle East, more intervene and fill that gap on non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to contrast these groups will have to invest more in not military tools.
filling that gap of governance has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and build peace.
If we understand armed groups, we understand what incentives to offer to promote the transition of violence to non-violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-zero-sums, military power can win some battles, but we won't give us peace and stability.
To achieve these targets, we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum of security, to fill that gap of governance that allowed these groups to thrive at a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are Venus, but I fear that accepting openly the label of``feminist"would be unfair for the feminist.
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I get stuck as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote an article, and a book called``The Bad feminist ,"and then in the interviews, people started calling me the Mila Female.
So, what started as a personal joke to myself and a deliberate production, has become a bigger thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth, and when I was 20, I had strange ideas about the feminist, these furry women, angry with men and hated sex, as if that was something wrong.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone who was using the people in the island that could be feminist.
Being tagged as a feminist was an accusation, a taboo and a nasty word.
They label me as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, that he's asking too much, with high self-esteem, and she dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that rebel woman, until he realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine to be another person.
Eventually, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also, proud of being.
For me, certain claims are fragile: women are equal to men.
We deserve the same paycheck for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we do, free of harassment or violence.
We have a right to use easy and accessible to contraceptives and reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for evangelical control or evangelical doctrines.
We have the right to the respect.
There's more.
When you talk about women's needs, you have to have our other identities.
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, gender expression, religion and sexuality, social condition, skills and much more.
We need to have these differences and how they affect us, the same way that what we have in common.
Without this kind of inclusion, our feminist is nothing.
For me, these truths are evident, but to be clear: I am a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive work, I listen to rap music for all volume.
Although the letter degraded women, and I was deeply offended, the classic``Salt Share"from the yin yang Twin is incredible.
\" Make it real with your wet t-shirt.
Parey, give up, move until you hurt your shell! ''
Think about it.
pure poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical tastes.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, including -- all the domestic tasks, but also killing insects, the garbage care, the care of the lawns and the maintenance maintenance.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
Moderate magazines and beautiful things.
I can see``The Ball ,"and the romantic comedy, and I have an absurd fantasies of the fairy fairy fairy tales.
Some of my crimes are more disaster.
If a woman wants to adopt the speed of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to judge.
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise his children, accept that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is confirmed so that women are economically vulnerable when they choose.
Let's solve this problem.
Reinvent the conventional feminist that has ignored or developed historically the needs of color women, workers, homosexuality and transgendered, for white, heterosexual, middle-class, middle class.
Listen, if that's good feminist, I'm a very bad feminist.
The next thing is: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put female feminist in a pedestal.
We hope you're going to take the perfection.
When we're disappointed, we retired them with a lot of taste from the same slope where we put them.
As I said, I I'm a disaster; I already considered me about that pedestal before you try to put there.
Too many women, particularly innovators and sector leaders, are afraid of being tagged as feminist.
They're afraid to stand up and say,``Yes, I I I I I I I I I, I, I'm feminist ,"by fear of what that sticker means, by fear, not to be able to fulfill with a little realistic expectations.
Take for example to Beijing, or as I call it, the God.
In the last few years, it's a decreased feminist.
In the Video Museum Adames , 2014, on MTV, in front of the word``feminist"of three meters tall.
It was a magnificent show, to look at this pop star openly embracing feminism and making women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
Last time, cultural critics began to have endless debates if Beijing was or not precisely feminist.
They rating their feminist, instead of just believing the word of an adult and mature woman.
We demand perfection of the feminist, because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so carefully a lot.
We go far beyond the sensible and constructive criticism, to design the feminist of any woman, to destroy it until nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminist, or rather, a more inclusive feminist is the point of departure.
But what happens next?
We've gone from recognizing our imperfections to realize, to go to action and be a little bit more brave.
If I hear a demeaning music, I I I I I, I I, I, I, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing an unlimited supply.
These artists will not change their way of talking about women in their songs until we manage change effectively affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does the music have to be so folded?
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are justify, it makes it harder for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve, and it's our responsibility.
I think about my nieces, three and four years old.
It's two magnificent, dense, brilliant girls, and also very brave . I want you to grow in a world.
It's being appreciated by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, suddenly, the best choice is volunteered as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program deals with sexual violence against women as sport, versus the Game of Thrones.
We can change the radio emitter when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema elsewhere when movies don't treat women more than as decorative objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports where athletes treat their companions as bush sacks.
In any case, men, especially white men, heterosexual men can say,``No, I won't publish in your magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a enough number of women, so much to participate and make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your publication, or your organization is more inclusive with a wider range of people . ''
Those of us who are overwhelmed but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also deny to be included until more like us are welcome to overcome barriers to the decision-making.
No longer, we're not a little bit of time . Without these efforts, without adopting these positions, our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and expect our decisions to reach the top, to people in the directors and producers of film and music, CEOs, the legislators, the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create lasting and meaningful change.
We can also trust our feminist, well, bad, or whatever.
The last line of my book``Bad feminist ,"he says,``It would prefer to be a bad feminist not to be at all . ''
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say it, especially, because I'm getting my voice stolen, and the feminist helped me to fix it.
There was an incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids doubled me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
They stole my voice, and after all I didn't think I could say something that could matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to writing.
I get back in a stronger version of myself.
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and women who looked like me and understand what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminist, I also discovered that if I was a little brave, another woman could hear and see that none of us is the nothing that the world tries to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I sustain the humiliating reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I I'm a good woman, I I I I I, I'm trying to improve my thinking, what I'm saying, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit brave, when you get such a courage.
Just after Christmas last year , 138 children in California had measles for having visited Disneyland or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, infecting over 100 children in Quebec.
One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that the measles that can be fatal for a child with a weakened immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century, but many of the kids involved in the Disneyland outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly worse: autism.
But a moment, wasn't the article that triggered the politics about autism and the vaccines that were described, depressed and marked by being a fraud by the British Medical Britannica?
Don't you think most intelligent scientists that the theory causing autism is a stupidity?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still trying to get vaccines to put their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rising estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and the pediatrician that I had heard about it, they created all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, prevalence estimates followed stable only three or four children per 10,000.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started shooting.
fundraising organizations like autism Superman is routinely referring to autism as an epidemic, as if I could contact another child in Disneyland.
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people in the Center of Disease Control Center, what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases as``extended diagnostic criteria ,"and``a better case detection"to explain these growing numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't scale a much the fears of a young mother who looks at the face of his two-year-old son, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to expand, why were they so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1990s?
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow and cautious progress of science that with the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how they discovered, but that story turned out to be false, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact in global public health.
There was a second more accurate history of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist, Leo Kanzi, from the Johns Hopkins Hospital . In 2003, Kanzi published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds, people around them, even their own parents.
They could be fun for hours by holding their hands in their faces, but they were prey from the panic by mentalities as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the base of patients treated in their clinic, Kanzi speculated that autism is very rare.
In the 1950s, as a major authority of the world in the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as I collected reference of places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprising, because Kanzi's criteria for autism diagnosis were very restrictive.
For example, respected to give that diagnosis to children with convulsions, but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was broken that he had converted nine in every 10 children sent by other doctors to his consultant for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
Kanzi was an intelligent man, but part of his theories were not hyperbole.
It classified autism as a form of child psychosis caused by cold and disaster parents.
These kids, he said, have been carefully kept in a refrigerator that not angry.
At the same time, though, Kanzi noticed that some of his young patients had special skills who are growing up in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 symphonies before the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said,``Beethoven . ''
But Kanzi had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like kids were just recording what they had heard of their pediatrician parents, desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
It wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of Kanzi that autism was rare.
Larry Lynch, Congress cognitive psychologist, thought that Kanzi's theory's theory was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John was warm and affectionate, and they had a deep autistic daughter called Susan.
And Lord and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like Susie without support services, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service that you needed more resources for autistic children and their families, Lord and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have been done 30 years before.
They did a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
He painted a suburb from London called Cambridge to try to find the autistic kids in the community.
What you saw was that the Kanzi model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
Some kids couldn't talk at all, while others were mad in their fascination for astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the genius of the race.
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and stands, as Judith said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the Rwandan monastery of Kanzi would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How didn't no one have ever noticed from these kids before?
But then Luria found a reference to an article published in German in 1944, next year to Kanzi's article, and then forgot, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
Kanzi knew about this article article, but he avoided explored to me in his own work.
There wasn't even a translation to English, but luckily, the husband of Toronto spoke German, and he translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man called Hans Assach, who would run an integrated clinic with an inner school in Vienna in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger for teaching children with learning differences were even progressive for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with kinds of exercises with music, and kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of autism, Asperger described it as a political disability of life that required compassion companies and spaces adapted during the course of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger called them their little teachers, and it was dedicated to help in the development of education methods that were especially suitable for them.
And fundamentally, Asperger saw autism as a diverse continuum that would run an amazing variety of gifts and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in architects known in pop culture as the social scientist, and the teacher destroyed.
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a fiber of autism is essential.
Larry and Judith discovered that Kanzi was wrong in which autism was infinite, as well as parents were the causes.
In the next few years, they worked silently with the American Association of psychiatry to expand diagnostic criteria that would reflect the diversity of what they called``autistic spectrum . ''
In the late 1980s, the early '90s, their changes came into the eye, subsiding the limited model of Kanzi by a wide and inclusive model of Asperger.
These changes don't fall in broken.
Almost, when Larry and Judith worked between foundations to reform these criteria, people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out,``Rain Man"in 1988, just a little circle, I knew what the autism was, but after the countless performance of Dusty Hoffman, as Railway Babbage and the recognition of``Rain Man"with four awards of Academy, pediatrician, psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, the first easy clinical trials of using to use autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of``Rain Man"changes in the criteria and the introduction of these trials created a network effect, a perfect storm of autism consciousness.
The number of diagnosis began to rise, just like they predicted Lordan and Judith, they actually expected it to be, getting people with autism and their families eventually got the support and the services they deserve.
So Andrew Washington came to blame vaccines in the diagnosis, a simple, powerful, credible history of credible history as bad as Kanzi theory that autism was infected.
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one in 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the largest minority groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have been united on the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve by the new medical advances, depending on the term``neuroscience"to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand neuroscience is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows, it doesn't mean it's broken.
According to autistic standards, the normal human brain is easily distributed, obviously social, and it suffers from a deficit deficit to detail.
Indeed, autistic people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching Asperger, which creates that the cure for the most exciting aspects of autism are in understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, support communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named Karach Keats once said,``We need all the hands in covered to get the ship of humanity . ''
As we sail towards a uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to leave a brain.
Thank you.
