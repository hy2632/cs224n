You know what I do is write for kids , and , in fact , I 'm probably the author for kids , more read .
And I always tell people , I do n't want to look like a scientist .
I can see as a farmer , or with leather clothing , and nobody has chosen a farmer .
I 'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies .
And you know that one epiphany , it 's something that you fell down somewhere .
You just have to go back to the apple , to see it as a epiphany .
That 's the painting of a circle .
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk> .
It 's the kind of complicated circle that I 'm going to talk about .
My circle started in the '60s at the middle school in the middle school , in <unk> , Ohio where I was the rare class . ''
When they were just laid down to bleed every week on the kids , until a teacher saved my teacher saved my life .
She saved my life by letting me go in the bathroom room .
I was doing it on the secret .
Three years .
And I had to leave the city .
I had a thumb , and 85 dollars , in San Francisco , I ended up in San Francisco , California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1980s , I felt the need to start working in organizations who were fighting AIDS .
About three or four years ago , half of the night I got a phone call from that teacher , <unk> lady , `` I need to see you .
I 'm disillusioned as adults , we 've never got to know .
You could be <unk> to Ohio , and please bring the man that you know .
And I 've got to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer , and I 'd like you to get it to please . ''
Well , the next day we were in Cleveland .
And we went to see it , we 're laughing , and we realized , she needed to be a <unk> .
We found a place , the <unk> , and we take care of her family , because it was necessary , and it was necessary .
It 's something we knew .
And as the woman who I wanted to know about as a adult came to find in a <unk> box , and it was put in my hands .
And what happened was that the circle had been closed , it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you about it .
The epiphany is that death is part of life .
She saved my life , my couple and saved my life of her .
And you know that part of life needs everything the rest of life .
It needs truth and beauty , and I 'm very happy that today , a lot about this now .
It also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure . And it 's our work to provide those things .
Thank you .
As an artist , the connection is very important to me .
Through my work , I 'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected .
I was for the first time in Antarctica , almost 10 years ago .
I was amazed .
My heart fast fast , was <unk> , trying to understand what was in front of me .
I would take them around the <unk> <unk> of water , and I could n't even think of it as a snowflake , it was about a snowflake year after year .
They 're born when they fall off the glaciers or break the ice shelves .
Every iceberg has its own individual personality .
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
Some are refuse to give up and clinging to the end , while others ca n't stand it anymore , and they 're going to become a dramatic passion of passion .
It 's easy to think , as a iceberg , that they are separate apart and alone as we see ourselves as humans .
But the reality is the opposite .
As a iceberg a iceberg , I 'm breathing its ancestral atmosphere .
As it melts a iceberg like rich sweet water in minerals that feeds many forms of life .
I come up close to photographing these icebergs as if it was the portraits of my ancestors from my ancestors , knowing that in these unique moments in that way , and it will not come back to it again .
It 's not death when they melt ; it 's not an end , but next to its path for life cycle .
Some of the <unk> ice that I 'm photographing is very young -- it has a couple of thousands of years .
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years .
The last pictures I 'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> , Greenland .
It 's very rare actually to get a iceberg on it .
Here they are .
You can see on the left a little boat .
It 's about five meters .
And I 'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg in the iceberg .
You can see here , he starts rolling , the boat has moved to the other side , and the man standing there .
This is a iceberg by Greenland , average size .
<unk> the water about 120 feet or 40 feet .
This video is in real time .
And just like that , the iceberg shows a different side of his personality .
Thank you .
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979 -- the same day , exactly at the same moment , a baby . Okay .
So , two couples each with a baby .
I do n't want to get up too much in the details of conception , because if you stop thinking about conception , I 'm not going to pay attention to .
Let 's think about it for a moment .
And on this stage , I want you to imagine that , in a case , the sperm and sperm joins the egg of the egg comes together .
And in the other case , the X-ray of the sperm binds to the X egg binds to the X egg comes together .
Both of them and start the life begins .
We 're going to go and talk about them later .
In my brain activity , two roles .
In one of my roles , I work with the history of the anatomy .
I 'm an historian of training and what I study in this case is the way people started to define the anatomy -- which is , of human bodies , people went through anatomy -- of human bodies -- of human bodies , what have thought about in the body 's fluids .
The other role that you can work in my work is an activist as they were an activist by patients , or , as I say sometimes , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In this case , I worked with people whose physical features defy social challenge challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy challenge defy
I 've been working , for example , with <unk> twins , two people inside the same body .
I worked with people with <unk> ; people are much lower than the average .
And I 've worked with a lot of many cases of people with classical sex people , individuals whose physical typology does not fit into the male and conventional female and conventional .
In general lines , we can call it <unk> .
<unk> adopt a lot .
I 'm going to give you a few examples of ways of having a sex that would n't be influenced by a male or female shapes .
For example , it 's the case of the individual with the <unk> , XY which gene <unk> the Y gene chromosome that we all have in fetal life , that we all have in fetal life .
And then , in fetal life , testicles make testosterone .
But because this individual lacks testosterone , the body does n't react to the same .
It 's <unk> syndrome .
So , there are high levels of testosterone , but no reaction .
As a consequence , the body develops by a <unk> race .
When he 's born , the baby looks a little bit .
He 's a little girl . He 's raised a little girl .
And often , not until puberty , when it 's growing up , when you 're growing up and developing the breasts , but you do n't have the menstrual period , but you have a menstrual period , when you realize something 's going on .
After doing they realize that instead of having ovaries and uterus , actually have testicles and uterus , actually have their testes and a chromosome .
What 's important to understand is that you might think it 's about a man , but actually not .
Women , as men , we have in the body something called the <unk> glands .
They 're in the back of the body .
<unk> glands produce <unk> , the hormone <unk> .
Most of women like myself -- I -- I think a typical woman -- does n't know its <unk> structure ; I think it 's a typical woman most women like I think are <unk> .
We 're producing <unk> , and we respond to the <unk> .
As a consequence , somebody like that , the more exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman born with testes who have the <unk> <unk> syndrome .
That 's why sex is complicated . It 's not that <unk> are in the middle of the spectrum -- in a way they can be everywhere .
Another example : a few years ago , I got a call from a 19-year-old called born and raised as a male boy , he was born and raised as a kid , he was wearing a life like he had had a kid and he had just found out she had a life as a boy and he had just found out he had ovaries and uterus .
It had an extreme way of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I had the 20th chromosomes , and in the womb <unk> glands , were so active , in essence , created a male hormone that 's male .
As a consequence , their genitals were exposed , his brain was exposed to the hormone component , the male component , the male , the male , the male , the male .
He was a little boy ; he was born with a little boy .
And it was at the 19 years , 19 , who started to have carried with medical menstruation problems , when the doctors found that , in fact , was a woman in fact .
Well , another quick example of a case of <unk> .
Some people with <unk> develop what is called what 's called <unk> , which is , they have tissue <unk> tissue wrapped in it .
We do n't know why that 's going on .
So , there are many of a lot of sex .
The reason for children with these kinds of bodies -- they are <unk> , twins twins , or they 're <unk> twins they were <unk> is not to be able to have a better physical health care .
In many cases , people are perfectly healthy .
The reason that they 're bringing several surgeries is that they 're a threat to our social categories .
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy of a particular sense of it .
We have the idea of being a woman is to have female identity ; supposedly , to be black to say African anatomy in historical terms .
A terribly simplistic idea .
And when it comes to us a body that shows quite different , we have trouble with <unk> .
So we have very romantic ideas with our culture of individualism culture .
Our nation is based on a very romantic individualism .
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born like two people within a same body .
The highest height is last year with the South African runner , with <unk> <unk> ; it 's put in the fabric of the <unk> .
A lot of journalists called it to ask me , `` What a test are you going to do to determine what if you 're going to perform the <unk> ? ''
And I had to explain to the reporters that there are not such a test .
In fact , we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature does n't trace a line between men and women and women and women and women and women and women and <unk> and women , we are , we draw that line .
So , what we have is a situation where the more advanced , the science , we have to admit that these categories were that were stable that they were going to were working directly into categories that went straight directly into a stable <unk> categories are much more <unk> than we thought .
And not only in terms of sex .
Also in terms of race , something that 's much more complicated than the terminology that the terminology allows .
As we see , we get into a rough terrain .
Let 's look , for example , the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees .
What 's the <unk> of the <unk> of them in just a few nucleotides ?
And as we moved in science , we get more and more in an awkward area where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories will probably be too simplistic .
And we 're looking at this in all walks of human life .
One of them , for example , in our current culture , in the United States today , are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life .
It 's hard to set up a moment from which one body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk> of <unk> .
There are very stubborn discussions nowadays <unk> , not in public , but it 's within the <unk> , when someone considers it dead .
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of if someone was dead .
As a lot of them put in a feather out in front of his nose , and if he was still moving on it .
If I stopped moving it .
But now we can , for example , extract organs from a body of a body and put them in another body .
And as a consequence , we have to deal with the dilemma that 's really a dilemma that we do n't have to actually have a hard time categories out of the last single categories that we do .
And you might think that this of this categories of categories might be happy as you might have .
I 'm progressive , progressive , people with unusual bodies , but I have to admit that I 'm nervous .
You know , these categories are much more unstable much more fragile than we were thinking about .
It 's going to be from the concept point of view of democracy .
And to tell you about this tension , I have to admit that I 'm a fervent <unk> of the Fathers .
I know they were racist , I know they were <unk> , but they were big .
I mean , they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did , that I find every watching that <unk> and watching that <unk> <unk> `` 1776 , '' which is totally <unk> .
It 's about what happened in 1776 with the Fathers .
The Founding Fathers were , for me , the first activists of the anatomy and explaining why .
What did n't have been an anatomic concept and <unk> with another that it was a radical , beautiful and beautiful , held for 200 years .
And as you all remember , what did n't have been aware of the monarchy was the idea of monarchy , the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
The old monarchs did not know the DNA , but they had clear the idea of birth of birth .
They had the concept of blood blue .
They were from the idea that was going to be political in political power by the father 's right being made by the father 's right being made by the father 's right being made by the father right then .
I rented them know rejected that that idea and replace it for a new concept of anatomy , and that concept was that all men are created the same .
They put up the field of play and decided that the anatomy that mattered , and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy of common in common and not differences .
And in part of it , they were doing it because they 're part of a <unk> system where two things happened .
It was raising democracy , and at the same time they were born science .
And it 's very clear , if you look at the story of the Fathers story , that many were very interested in in science and in the idea of a naturalist .
They were <unk> from the supernatural explanations , and thus rejected the concept of supernatural power being passed through from birth vague idea of birth .
They were moving into a naturalist concept .
And if you look , for example , the Declaration of Independence Independence and the god of nature .
They do n't think about God and God 's nature .
They talk about power of nature to tell us who we are .
And a consequence , they were spreading the idea of anatomical coincidence .
And by doing so , they were laid the foundations of the future the Civil Rights movement .
They did n't think that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
And what happened next year ?
And women succeeded .
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people of <unk> <unk> , which said , `` I 'm not a woman ? ''
We found men in the lines of Civil Rights and saying , `` I 'm a man . ''
Again , of color people who have <unk> an anatomical coincidence about anatomical difference , again succeeded .
We see the same thing with the <unk> Movement .
The problem is , of course , as we look at the coincidences , we need to start asking why we have certain divisions .
But , attention , I want to keep some anatomical divisions in our culture .
For example : I do n't want to give a fish the fish like a fish .
I do n't want to say that we need to be able to deal with anatomy .
I do n't want to say that five years of age were supposed to be allowed to have sex or marry .
There are some anatomical divisions for me to make sense , and that I think we should keep .
But the challenge is to try and figure out what they are , why keep them up and make sense .
Well , let 's go back to those two beings at the beginning of this talk .
We have two beings , both <unk> in the mid-'70s exactly the same day .
Let 's imagine one of them , Mary was born three months before : June 1 .
Henry , on the contrary , born in a term born of 1980 .
For one fact , I had been born three months earlier that Mary attribute all three months before Henry -- right before Henry -- right consent , the right to vote , the right to vote .
Henry has to wait for all of that not because I have a different biological age , but because it was a different , because it was born .
We find other oddities in the relationship to their rights .
Henry , in virtue of being considered man , if I have n't told whether it 's <unk> , by virtue of being considered as well , by virtue of being considered as well as Mary name does n't .
Mary , they do n't have the same rights to marriage than Henry in all states , for example .
Henry can be married in every single states with a woman , but Mary can marry one woman in some states .
And so still these anatomic categories still are in various ways and questionable .
And now the question is : What do we do that science move so much in the field of the anatomy , which we have to admit that a democracy based on anatomy .
I do n't want to give up science , but at the same time sometimes I feel like science escapes to us .
Where are we going ?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a pragmatic attitude : `` Well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we 're going to do it . ''
But a lot of people are stuck in a very rare position .
For example : Texas at some point has decided that to get married with a man you do n't have to have chromosome up , and to get married with a woman , you have to get married and get married with a woman you have to get married .
Now , in practice do n't do exams , they do n't make exams .
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to the <unk> .
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , Dr. Martin Luther King , in his speech , `` I 'll offer A <unk> offers a solution . ''
It says that we should be judging the people , not based on the color of their skin , but in the contents of their character , '' going beyond the anatomy .
And I want to say , `` Yeah , the idea looks pretty good . ''
But in practice , how do you do ?
How do you judge people based on the content of their character ?
I want to point out , also , I 'm not sure that we should be able to get involved in it for rights to people , because I 've to admit that , I know that I know some <unk> of people who probably deserve more social services than some of the people I know .
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know you can make informed , informed and mature decisions about your sexual activity that you know .
So how do you put the character of character content ?
It 's very difficult .
And a part of myself wonder what would happen if the character of one person could in the future will be measured by an instrument , maybe an MRI .
Do we really want to get to that point ?
I 'm not sure where we go .
What I know is that it seems to be very important that America is going to continue this current thinking relative to the subject of democracy .
We 've done a good job of defense of democracy , and I think we 're going to do a good job in the future .
We do n't live , for example , in a context like an Iranian man who feels for other men is susceptible to other men is susceptible to other men , which case it 's going to be able to live out of a sex change , where it 's going to be allowed to live .
We 're not in that situation .
I 'm glad to say that we do n't have a context like the one that I talked about a couple of years ago that he had made to give birth twins to and then they pick up them and they grow their fame .
But when the phone asked him , the reason was called a <unk> operation , and he told me that in that another country , these children would be very abused and therefore he had to say .
And I said , `` Well , it 's considered the political asylum instead of separation ? ''
America offers tremendous possibilities to people to be who they are without <unk> to change from the state .
So I think we have to be on your head .
Well , to conclude , I mean , I 've been talking to you a lot about the fathers .
And I want to think about what democracy would be like , or as it might have been , if we had given to the Mothers .
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , and that is that I think there can be different ideas from different anatomy , in particular if there are people thinking out there from different anatomy , in particular if there are people thinking in a group .
Since years ago , since I 've been interested in <unk> , I 've also been interested in researching the sexual difference .
And one of the things that has been interested in the differences between men and women in the way to think and operating in the world .
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women , on average , is that women , but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to social social relationships , and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group .
And if we think about that , we have an interesting situation in our hands .
So years ago , when I was in graduate school , one of my advisers who I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> as a feminist , like <unk> , like <unk> made me a stranger apologize .
`` Tell me what 's got out of feminine . ''
And I thought , `` It 's the dumbest question I 've ever heard .
Feminism has to do with undo the gender stereotypes , so there 's nothing wrong with feminism . ''
But the more I 've thought about his question , I 've got a little bit like there 's a female on feminism .
So , there might be something , on average , something different from the female 's brain and the male that makes us more nourishing social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable .
So , if the fathers were very attentive to find out how to protect people from the state , it 's possible to find the way that we 've got more Mothers to bring to this concept , perhaps we would have an enriched protection of the concept of reciprocal support .
And maybe that 's what we need to do in the future , and take democracy beyond the anatomy : to think less about individual body , in terms of thinking more about relationships .
So as we try to create a more perfect union , let 's think what we are doing for the others .
Thank you .
In the year 2007 , I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development .
Our new goal our goal should be that when every family to think about where they want to go live and work , have the possibility of going to live between at least a bunch of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents .
Well , right now we 're far from that goal .
There are billions of people in developing countries that do n't count a single city , willing to <unk> .
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth so cost .
So we could easily prescribe the world , the tens of hundreds of new cities .
Well , this may sound absurd if you 've never thought about new cities .
But they just took them through apartment buildings .
Imagine that half that you wanted to live in apartments are already owners , they were owners , and to the other half , we have even missed it to do it .
You could try to increase the capacity by making <unk> in all the existing buildings .
But you know that the problem that you 're going to <unk> is that those buildings and areas that are around you have to avoid the discomfort and the areas of the construction .
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk> .
But they could go to a whole new place , and they could build a new apartment building , always , and when the rules of that drop , we could always go into the building .
So I suggested that governments will develop new zones of reform to contain big enough and gave them a name cities .
I later found out later , and at the same time , <unk> and <unk> were really thinking about the challenge of Honduras .
They knew that every year from 75,000 <unk> would know from their country to go to the United States , and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras .
In the summer 2009 in 2009 happened by a constitutional crisis .
In the next regular elections , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform at the same platform at the same time .
He asked him to be his head of cabinet .
Meanwhile , I was preparing a talk at TEDGlobal .
Through a process of refinement , trial and error and a lot of a lot of evidence with users , I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under charter to their most essential ideas .
The first dot was the importance of rules , like those rules that say that you ca n't go and bother all the current apartments .
It really takes a lot of attention to new technologies , but it 's needed both technologies to make progress , and usually it 's the rules that can keep us from .
In the fall of 2010 , a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link with the TEDTalk .
I showed it to <unk> .
They called me .
They said , `` Let 's call this to the leaders of our country . ''
So in December , we came together in Miami in a hotel conference room .
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are cities , much more valuable than your monetary cost .
And I used this image that shows the ground in a place like New York City , and look a look , land , land , thousands of dollars per square meter .
But it was a pretty abstract discussion , and at some point , when there was a pause , <unk> said , `` `` Paul , maybe you might be able to see the video of the TEDTalk said . ''
And the talk described in very simple terms than a charter city is a place where it begins with <unk> land , a charter that sets the rules that will be activated there and a choice for people can choose if they want to go and live under those rules .
So the president of Honduras ' president , and told me that we had to do this project , this is important , this could be the way that our country moved forward .
He asked me to be <unk> , and I 'd talk about the four and five of January .
So I presented another talk full of data , which included a picture like this , which was what was trying to explain that is a lot of value to a city , this has to be very large .
This is a picture of Denver and the white line is the new airport that was built in Denver .
Just this airport is <unk> over 100 square miles .
So I was trying to convince you that to build a new city , you have to start with a site , you have to start with a site that measuring at least 1,000 square miles .
That 's over 100,000 hectares .
The whole world <unk> <unk> .
The face of the public 's faces were very serious and attentive .
The Congress leader came to the platform and said , `` Professor <unk> , thank you for his talk , but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk .
I have this computer here . ''
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk .
And this explained is essential that a new city can offer new options for people .
There would be a choice of a city that could be going to be in Honduras , rather than hundreds of miles away from the North .
And it also includes new options for leaders .
Because the government leaders of Honduras would need help from partnership of Honduras , they could benefit from the countries associated with which they can establish them to establish the charter of the charter .
We went and saw a site .
This picture is out there .
It could easily cover a few square square miles .
And soon after , the 19th of January , they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and adding a constitutional disposal that would allow us to create these special regions of development .
In a country that had just gone through this painful crisis , the voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was <unk> to one .
All the parties , all the parties in society , all the way in society .
For <unk> in the Constitution , you have to pass twice in Congress .
On February 17 again , it passed on again in another voting , of Complexity to one .
Immediately after the voting , from the 21st to February on the February of 30 to 30 degrees , was to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in the building .
One of them is South Korea .
This is a picture of a new big <unk> of the city that is being built in South Korea -- is bigger than the Boston center .
Everything you see there was built in four years , after that spent four years getting the permissions .
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore .
In fact , they 've already built two cities in China and they 're getting ready for a third .
And if you think about this , practical is where we are .
They have a site , and they 're thinking about a site for the second city .
They 're preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to come in , and then it would allow them to operate under an external legal system .
A country has already committed to allowing his Supreme Court to allow the Supreme Court to allow for this new court system .
There are urban <unk> and builders of cities who are very interested in the project .
They even can even get some funding funding .
But the only thing we know has already solved is that they have a good number of people .
There are many companies they wanted to move in the Americas , especially in a place with a free trade , and there are a lot of people who 'd like to go to live there .
In the world , there are 700 million people who say they 'd be changed immediately another place .
There 's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States .
Many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to get a job , and they 're going to get a job , and they 're going to get a job , and they are sometimes mothers who have to make the money and just eat the money .
Unfortunately , sometimes even there are even children who are trying to meet their parents who have n't seen , in some cases , in a decade , in a decade .
So what does it seem to think about building a new city building in Honduras ?
Or would you build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these all over the world ?
What does it seem to think about insist so that families can choose between a number of cities that are competing for various cities ?
This is an idea worth spreading .
And my fancy friends was asked : `` Thank you TED . ''
I 'm <unk> , and this is my <unk> .
But before I show you what 's inside , I 'm going to make a public confession , and you 're living obsessed with costumes .
I love finding , and more recently , photographing , to photograph and publish it on my blog and bold , colorful and different one for each time .
But I do n't buy anything new .
All of my clothes is from second hand markets and <unk> stores .
Oh , thank you .
So the second hand stores me allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment , and in my wallet .
I come up to know people -- usually my money is going to make a good cause , and I 'm going to buy it 's unique , and buy it turns into my personal search staff of treasures .
I mean , what am I going to find out today ?
Will my size be about my size ?
Would you like the color ?
Will less than 20 dollars ?
If all the answers are positive , then I feel like I 've won .
So back to the subject of my <unk> , I want to tell you what I packed in for this exciting week at TED .
I mean , what does it bring to you all the clothes ?
So I 'm going to show you exactly what I brought .
I brought seven into the inner clothing , and nothing else .
Just a week inside of exactly a week , it 's all I put in my <unk> .
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I 'd like to use after I got here to Palm Springs .
And because you do n't know how the woman walking from TED in underwear , that means I found some things .
And I 'd like to show you now the collections for this week .
Does n't sound interesting ?
As I do , I 'm also , I 'm also going to tell you some of the lessons that I believe , believe it or not , I 've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes .
Let 's start with Sunday .
I call this a brilliant tiger I call it .
You do n't spend a lot of money to see .
You almost always see you just about 50 dollars .
All the together , including the jacket jacket , and it took me 55 , and it 's the most expensive thing I 've used the week .
It 's energy on the color .
It 's almost impossible <unk> impossible , and when you 're wearing a bright red pants red trouser .
If you 're happy , you 're going to attract other happy people .
Tuesday : integration is <unk> .
I 've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk> .
I just know yourself .
If you 'll tell you from the right people , you do n't just understand , too .
<unk> : <unk> of the kid you inside .
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> , or I remind you of your seven-year-old little kid .
I like to <unk> and say , `` Thank you . ''
Thursday : trust is the key .
If you think you 're okay with something , it 's almost sure you 're .
And if you think it does n't look good at something , it 's probably probably true .
My mother taught me this day after day .
But it was n't until the age of 30 years I really understood .
And I 'll explain it in a few seconds .
If you think you 're a beautiful person inside your interior and outside , you ca n't look at it .
So there 's no excuse for anyone in this audience .
We must be able to achieve everything we want .
Thank you .
<unk> : A universal truth will be six words for you : Golden <unk> go with everything .
And finally , Saturday : Developing a personal personal style , a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
I 've tried this again and again when people were approaching me this week simply by what I was using this week , and we had fantastic conversations .
Obviously all of this wo n't go into my little <unk> .
So before I go home , I 'm going to give it all .
Because the lesson I 'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave some other stuff .
I do n't need any emotional <unk> to these things , because back in the corner corner , there will always be another mad , colorful suit , and brilliant <unk> , if there 's a little bit of love , colorful and brilliant <unk> , if there 's a little bit of love in my heart and look for it . ''
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
This is a representation of your brain that we can split up on two parts .
The left side , the left part , which is the logic , right side , right ?
So , if you take a scale to measure the fitness 's fitness , we could design a blueprint for our brain .
For example , this would be somebody who is completely logical .
This is somebody who is totally intuitive .
So where is your brain on this scale ?
Some of them are <unk> by one of these extremes , but I think for most of the members of this audience , their brain is something like this -- with great fitness in both hemispheres of the same time .
It 's not to be mutually exclusive .
You can be logical , intuitive .
I consider myself one of those people , like most of the other quantum quantum physical physicists , we need quite a logic for these complicated ideas .
But at the same time , we need quite intuition that really work .
How do we develop this intuition ? Well , we like to play with things .
We 're going to play with them and then we see how they react to that , and then we see how they react to that point .
And actually , you do the same thing .
A little intuition that you can have developed over the years of the years is that that one thing can be only in place at once .
I mean , it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time , but you were not born with this notion of two different places .
I remember looking at a kid playing on a parking bar .
It was a small kid , and it was not very good at falling .
But I bet that playing with that game in that parking lot , and he taught a valuable lesson , and that 's that big , and that 's that big , they do n't allow it to stay in a place .
This is a big conceptual framework that you can have from the world , except you 're a particle physicist .
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they do n't play a parking bars , they play these weird little particles .
And when they play their particles , they find all kinds of things really bizarre -- like they can go through walls , or they can go through two different places at the same time .
And then they wrote all these observations , and they called it theory theory of quantum mechanics .
At that point , it was the physics few years ago ; you needed from the quantum mechanics to describe those small particles .
But you did n't need it to describe the big objects around us every day .
That did n't fit to my intuition , and maybe it 's because I do n't often play with particles .
Well , sometimes play with them , but not a lot .
And I 've never seen you .
I mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
But it did n't fit my work well at my logic .
Because if you 're all made out of little particles and all the small particles continue to do the principles of quantum mechanics , then it should n't all go on the principles of quantum mechanics ?
I do n't find the reason why .
And therefore I would feel a lot better way if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follow the principles of quantum mechanics .
That 's why I set up a few years ago , I set up exactly that .
And I did .
This is the first object that you can see in a overlap of quantum mechanical mechanics .
What we see here is a small computer chip .
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle .
That 's the little bit of metal that I 'm going to talk about in a minute .
This is a picture of the object .
And here I 'll zoom in it a little bit . It 's right in the center .
And then we zoom in a great big look at the small metal <unk> .
What we see is a little bit of tiny , a springboard form and a springboard <unk> supported by a platform .
And then I did almost like this sort of computer chip .
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip , and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours .
For the last material , I had to build my own kind of machine -- to make this hole in which <unk> <unk> swimming under the device .
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap , but for it needs a little help .
Let me make an analogy .
You know how uncomfortable that it is to be in an elevator full of people .
I mean , when I 'm on an elevator course , I do all kinds of strange things , but then when other people will go up and do those things , because I do n't want them to bother doing those things , because I do n't want to bother them , or , really , scary .
Quantum mechanics is that inanimate objects are behave in the same same way .
<unk> journey of inanimate objects are not only people , but it 's the light that it 's light and the wind that goes on to their side and the wind 's going up .
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics , we would have to <unk> all the other passengers .
And that 's what we did .
We collected the lights , then we introduced a vacuuming , and pulled out all the air , and then we cool it into a temperature of less than absolute zero degree .
Now , when you 're just on the elevator , the little bit of metal , is free of acting as it wants .
So we measured their movements .
We discovered that it was moving in very strange ways .
Instead of staying perfectly still , I was vibrating . And the way that <unk> was like a breath of this way -- like a tripod that it expands , it 's kind of like a penny of this way .
And by giving him a smooth shot , we were able to make it <unk> , and not at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics .
So what I 'm telling you is really fantastic .
What does it mean that we do n't have to do it at the same time ?
Let 's think about atoms .
In one case : all the trillions of atoms make that piece of metal are still in and at the same time that same atoms are being moving up and down .
It 's just in certain points when you line up .
In the rest of the time , they 're <unk> .
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places .
I think this is great .
Really .
It was a clean sentence on a clean room to do this for all of those years , because , look at this , the difference on scale between one single atom and so that little bit of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal .
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time , and that piece of metal can be in two different places , why do n't you ?
I mean , it 's my logic part that speech .
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time , how would that be ?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space ?
There 's another part of the story .
And it 's when we heat it up , and we turned the lights and look at the lights , we saw that the metal was still in a single piece .
And I could get to this new intuition , apparently all the objects in the elevator actually are just quantum objects that are just so forth on a small space .
You hear about talking a lot about that is that quantum mechanics claims it 's all interconnected .
Well , that 's not true .
That 's more profound .
It 's that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define them who are , and that 's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics .
Thank you .
My name is <unk> .
And 18 months ago , I was doing a Google job of Google , until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and I launched my boss who is here and it allowed me to take him out .
It took me 18 months and then .
Many negotiations and stories , I assure , with 17 museums , very interesting museums from nine .
But I 'm going to focus on the demo .
There 's a bunch of stories of why we did .
I think my own story is explaining simply in this slide , and this is access .
I grew up in India .
I 'm having a major education -- but I did n't have access to many of these museums and art of art .
So when I started traveling and go to museum , I began to learn a lot .
And working on Google , I try to actually make the desire more accessible by technology .
So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we start to do it .
So better I show the demo , and then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we 've done from their launch .
So simply , we 're going to <unk> .
Look around every museum there .
There 's the <unk> gallery , MoMA , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> van Gogh .
I actually go into one of my favorites , by <unk> , the art museum in New York .
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple .
We click , <unk> !
It does n't matter where they are , Bombay or <unk> , that does n't really care .
You move around and you have fun and you have fun .
Do you want to navigate the museum ?
We opened up on the top , and , with one click , we click on it .
They 're inside , you want to go at the end of the hall .
You go ahead and go ahead . Get yourself .
<unk> .
Thank you , but I do n't know the best .
Now I 'm in front of one of my favorite favorite paintings , `` The <unk> . ''
I see the sign + .
If the museum shows us the image , we click there .
Look , this is one of the images .
Here 's all the data of metadata .
For those of you who are really interested in the art , you can click there , but I 'm going to click here , right now .
And this is one of the images we 've captured in what we call <unk> technology .
So this image , for example , it contains , I think , about 10,000 million pixels .
And there are a lot of people who ask me , `` What do you get to 10,000 million of the pixels ? ''
So I 'm going to show you what you really get to do with 10 million pixels .
You can zoom in in a very simple way .
You see things fun that are going on .
I love this guy , his expression has no price .
But if you really want to go into a lot .
So , I started playing , and I was found with something that was happening there .
And I said , `` A moment . This is interesting . ''
I went in and discovered that children were actually playing something .
I did a little research , I talked with some people from the <unk> , and I actually discovered that this is a game called called [ unclear ] , which is about hit a <unk> on a Tuesday .
And apparently it was very popular .
I do n't know why they did , but I 've learned something about it .
And now we 're going to get deeper in the depth , and you 'll see that you can actually get the cracks .
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective , I 'm going to pull the image , so you 'll see you really see .
Here 's where we were , and this is painting .
The best thing is coming , a second .
So now we 're going quickly quickly jump at MoMA again at MoMA again .
Here 's another one of my favorites , `` The Night <unk> . ''
The example I showed you was to find details .
But what if you want to see the <unk> ?
And if you want to see how van van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
It goes up and really does it .
I 'm going to one of my favorite favorite parts in this picture , and I 'm really going to go to cracks .
This is `` overnight <unk> , '' I think I 'd never seen this before .
I 'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions .
There are many things over here , but I do n't have a time to show them .
This is the really cool part . It 's called `` <unk> . ''
All of you , absolutely everyone , does n't care if you 're rich or poor , or you 've got a mansion .
You can online , you can create your own museum , create your own collection of these images .
It 's very simple , in we go in , I 've created this function that I call zooming from zooming in -- we just zoom in on it .
This is `` <unk> '' at the National Gallery in London .
You can write things out , send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you 're looking at at looking at these masterpieces about what you feel at contemplating these artworks .
So in conclusion , I think for me , the main thing is that all really amazing things do n't come from Google .
No , in my opinion , even come from the museums museum .
Maybe I should n't say this .
It actually comes from those artists .
And that has been my humble experience with this .
I mean , I hope in this digital medium , do justice , and it 's represented properly online .
And the big question I 'm doing today is , `` You did this to repeat the experience of going to a museum ? ''
And the answer is not .
It 's to supplement experience .
And that 's all . Thank you .
Thank you .
Good afternoon .
I have something to show you . ''
Think pixel , a pixel .
In our lab , we call responsive design .
I 'll tell you a little bit about this .
If you look at this picture -- I 'm from Italian , all children in Italy , growing up with this photo in his bedroom , but the reason I show you this is that something really interesting happened in the tracks of Formula 1 in the last two decades .
Now , some time , if you wanted to win a year of Formula 1 , take a budget and would take a budget off and put it into a good pilot and get it to a good car .
And if the car and the pilot was good enough , you made the race .
This is what , in engineering , it 's <unk> control system .
It 's essentially a system that has two components : a sensor and a <unk> .
Now what 's interesting about is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives .
Our cities , over the last few years , have been covered with networks and electronics .
They 're getting free computers .
And like such , they 're starting to respond differently , and they can be detected and they can be screened and <unk> .
You know , cities is big .
As a note note , I want to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet , but they represent 50 percent of the world 's crust .
Seventy-five percent of energy consumption -- and to 80 percent of energy from the CO2 emissions .
If we could do something with cities , it would be a big thing .
Beyond cities , all of these detections , all of these detections , and they 're going to get it into our everyday objects .
This is from an exhibition from Limb <unk> for the end of this year at MoMA 's end .
It 's called `` TEDTalk to me . ''
Well , our objects , the environment , start telling us .
In a way , it 's like almost all of the existing atoms were to become sensors and actuators .
And that 's completely changing the interaction that we have with the outside environment .
It 's almost like in the old sense of Michelangelo .
You know , Michelangelo carved in Moses , he 's said that in the end , he 's finally taken the hammer , and he came up with Moses , in you , you know , you can still see a little <unk> , and he said , `` Oh , `` <unk> , <unk> Garden ? ''
Well , today , our environment starts to speak to us .
And I 'm going to show you just a few examples -- <unk> , <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment and push something .
Let 's start with detection .
The first project I want to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab .
This was four and a half years ago in Italy .
It was a summer with the kind of 2006 .
It was the year where Italy won the World Cup .
Maybe some of you remember , they played Italy and France , and at the end of the <unk> gave the <unk> .
And anyway , at the end , at the end , in the end , in the end , in the end .
Now let 's see what happened that day looking at activity in the network .
Here we see the city .
You see the Coliseum in the middle and the River <unk> .
It 's the morning , before the game .
The timeline is at the top .
So later , early people over here and call them , moving around .
It starts the party : silence .
<unk> in France , <unk> in Italy .
<unk> , people do a call fast and goes to the bathroom .
Second time . End of <unk> .
The extra time ; second .
<unk> , and at a moment , <unk> .
They win Italy , yes !
That night , they all went to celebrate the center .
There you see the great peak .
The next day they were in the center I find out the winner and the prime minister at the time .
And then everybody came down .
You see the picture of the site called <unk> , where , from the Roman stage time , people are going to celebrate ; it 's a big party , you can see the summit at the end of the day .
This is just an example of how today you can measure your city 's pulse of a city that we could not just do a few years ago .
Another quick example of detection , it 's not about people , but things we use and consume them .
Today we know everything about the background of our objects .
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac , how they put it together .
But we know very little about where things go .
So in this project , we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash tags on its shift in the system .
We started with some volunteers volunteers and helped us in Seattle a bit more than one year , <unk> what they were throwing out , different kinds of things , as you can see , things that anyway .
And then we then put a little chip , and a sticker , and then we started to start <unk> .
These are the results from it .
From Seattle ...
after a week after a week .
And with this information we realized there is a lot of inefficiencies in the system .
We can do the same thing with much less energy .
These are data that did n't exist .
They 're happening complicated stuff , and there 's very unnecessary transportation .
But the other thing that we believe is that if you look at all the days that the cup that we <unk> not away , that 's still somewhere on the planet , that 's still gone .
If it 's a plastic bottle that he <unk> one day still .
If we show them , then we 're going to be able to promote some behavior change .
That was the reason for the project .
My colleague at MIT , <unk> <unk> , could tell us much more about detection , and many other great things that we can do with that , but I wanted to go to the second part , but I wanted to go to the second part we 've talked about at the beginning , which is push , but I wanted to go to the second part .
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk> .
It all started with a mayor of city , which came and told us that the Spain and the South of Europe , they have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces in public spaces .
And the question was , how can technology , new technology , to join that ?
And one of the ideas that we 've developed at MIT , in a workshop , it was : imagine you have an trunk and valves , valves of <unk> , <unk> valves .
It creates like a curtain was created by water .
If you fall down the pixels , you can type in them , show patterns , images , text .
And when you zoom in , the curtain will open up so that we can go through , as you see in the image .
We introduced this to the mayor .
He liked him .
And we had a commission to design a commission to the Expo .
We call this Digital Water .
The entire building is made of water .
There are no doors or windows , but when you 're coming up here , it opens so you can get to go .
The ceiling is also also covered in water .
And if there 's a little bit of wind , if you want to minimize the <unk> , you get down the roof .
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears , like in this case .
Those days there will always be somebody , in the winter , when you go down the ceiling , somebody who was there and said , `` You know , <unk> the building .
No , it 's not that they 've been demolished , but when it comes down almost all of the architecture away .
Here it is working .
You see people are looking for what 's going on .
And here I 'm trying not get wet when the sensors opening up the sensors .
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working on it .
That night was actually even more fun .
So all of the <unk> children came to the building because the way we could interact a little bit .
It was no longer a building opening to let leave , but a building that was still making slices and water holes , and you had to jump up to get wet .
( Audience Noise ) And for us , it was very interesting because architects , engineers , designers , we always think about the use of the use that people will give our designs .
But then the reality is always unpredictable .
And that 's the beauty of doing things to interact , that people use .
This is a picture of the building , physical pixels , the water pixels , and of course , of course .
And this is what led us to thinking about the next project I 'm going to show you .
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly .
Imagine you could imagine you could have little helicopters in the air that each had a little pixel , it changes color like a cloud that moves in space .
This is the video .
Imagine a helicopter , like what we saw before , moving with others in synchrony .
We could form this cloud .
It 's kind of a flexible screen like this one with a normal screen in two dimensions .
Or normal , but in three dimensions , where what it changes is the light , not the pixels .
You can play with a different kind of kind of different way .
Imagine that the screen would appear in different scales and sizes , in different types of resolution , in different kinds of resolution .
And then all of this could be a pixel of 3D pixels in the 3D one that you can go through , and go through , and see from very different angles and to go through it and see it .
This is the real <unk> controlled , going down <unk> to form a V , like before .
When the light lights up , it looks like this .
Imagine each of you controlled by a person .
We can have every pixel with a input that comes from people , the movement of people , etc. , etc. , etc .
I want to show you something for the first time .
We 've been working with <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers from today , the New York City 's <unk> star and La Scala <unk> in New York , and we 've been working on <unk> to capture their 3D motions .
Here we can see <unk> dancing .
On the left see the pixels , it 's caught up in different resolutions .
It 's so much 3D , in real time as real time as motion capture .
It can make all the motion .
You can go through all the way .
And once we have the pixels we can play with them , with the color and the color and the movement , and the rotation and rotation time .
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk> .
I wanted to show you the last project we 're working in .
It 's something for the London Olympics .
It 's called the Cloud .
And the idea is , imagine again , that we could engage people , to do something and change our environment together and change our environment as a breeding farm like the barn , but with a cloud .
Imagine that we could make you all <unk> a little bit like a pixel .
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that , in the last two decades , we went from the physical world to the digital world .
Now , we 've digitized digitized all , like knowledge , accessible to the Internet .
Today , for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> , we can go through the digital world , self-organizing power , the physical world .
In our case , this may we want to design and make a symbol .
That would mean something built in a city .
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges today , think about climate change , or CO2 change , how to move from the digital world to the physical world ?
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together , collectively .
The cloud is a cloud , again , made of the pixels of the same same way that the actual cloud of the particles .
And those particles , these particles , as in our cloud are pixels .
It 's a physical structure in London , but it covered in pixels .
You can move inside , you have different experiences .
You can see it from the bottom , serve to share the major moments of the Olympics in 2012 , and even more , and it can be used as a way of connection to the community .
So , it 's both a physical cloud of heaven as something you can get up , like a new top of London .
You can get in there .
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night , but most importantly , it 's going to be a new experience for anyone who is going to the top .
Thank you .
Would you like to be better than what are they ?
Suppose I told you that , with only a few changes in your genes , you could improve the memory -- for a more accurate , more accurate , more accurate and faster .
Or maybe you might want to be in better ways , be stronger .
Would you like to be more attractive and safer of yourself ?
How about living more with good health ?
Or maybe those people who always want to be more creative .
What else would you like ?
What would you like , if you could choose something ?
( Audience Audience Member ) Creativity .
How many people would people do ?
Raise your hand . Let me see .
Few of us have probably got the number of creative creative people in .
That 's very good .
How many would you choose the memory ?
A few more .
And the physical state ?
A little less .
How about longevity ?
Oh , most of it . That makes me feel very well as a doctor .
If you could have something about this , the world would be very different .
Is it just imagination ?
Or maybe be possible ?
Evolution has been a theme theme here at the TED Conference , but today I want to give you a doctor about the subject .
The great <unk> of the 20th century , <unk> , <unk> , which also <unk> in the <unk> Church , he wrote an essay called `` Nothing in biology , makes sense of `` Nothing in terms of Evolution . ''
But if we effectively accept biological evolution , this is , it 's just about the past , or the future ?
Was to the other or us ?
This is another looking at the tree of life .
The human part of this branch , well at one end , of course , the most interest of us .
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six million years ago .
There have been maybe 20 25 different species of hominids of hominids .
Some of them have gone back and forth .
We 've been here about <unk> years .
It might seem like that we 're very far from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , most of the basic individual machinery of our cells are more or less the same basic machinery of life .
Do you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human bacteria , to produce the diabetes ?
This is not like human insulin , but it 's the same protein , chemically indistinguishable from that , which comes out of the pancreas .
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry in the world 's more bacteria that we have in the rest of the body ?
Maybe 10 times .
I mean , think , think , when Antonio Damasio , do you think about the bacteria ?
The gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria .
It 's warm , dark , wet , is very welcoming .
And we 're going to provide all the nutrients that they can want to want with without effort on .
It 's really like a quick for the bacteria with a occasional predictable disruption in the bacteria <unk> .
But by the other , we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life .
They help digest nutrients essential , and protect us from certain diseases .
But what lies in the future ?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary balance ?
Or was it meant to become something different from the environment ?
In this vast symphony <unk> symphony , life on Earth is just like a brief compass -- the animal kingdom , like the animal and only a single <unk> -- and human life , a little bit of graceful .
That was us .
And it was also the entertaining part of this talk , so I hope they 've enjoyed losing the very enjoyed .
Now , when I first went back to college , I had my first class of biology .
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
I fell in love with the power of evolution , and I realized something fundamental about the existence of the life of the life , in treatment organisms , every cell genetic energy and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two cells .
But when the multicellular organisms appear , things began to change .
<unk> the sex reproduction .
And something very important : with the emergence of sexual reproduction , the rest of the body becomes <unk> .
In fact , you could say that the inevitability of death from the body in evolution in evolution in sexual reproduction .
I have to tell you that when I was a college student , I thought , well , you know , <unk> , you know , death for sex ; it seemed pretty reasonable for you to do , but it seemed pretty reasonable at that time , but with every year that was going , most <unk> .
I got to understand the feelings of George Burns , who still performing in Vegas well in their 90s years .
And one night somebody hits his hotel door to her hotel .
He opens the door .
In front of him , it 's a wonderful <unk> dancer in clothing .
He looks at it and says , `` I came up with a `` Sex ' soup . ''
`` Okay , '' he says George , `` I choose the soup . ''
I realized , as a doctor , who I was working on for a different goal of evolution , not necessarily necessarily <unk> , just different .
I was trying to preserve the body .
I wanted us to get healthy .
I wanted to recover health in the disease .
I wanted to live more and more healthy .
Evolution is about moving the next generation , adapting and <unk> and <unk> generation .
Since an evolutionary view of you and I are like <unk> rockets to send the genetic burden to the next level , and then let us fall into the sea .
I think we all would understand the feeling that expressed Allen when he said , `` I do n't want to get immortality through my work .
I want to do it not dying . ''
Evolution does not necessarily make longevity .
It does n't necessarily give the bigger or stronger the most intelligent , and even the smarter and even smarter .
Evolution favors the world 's best adapted to their environment .
That 's the only test for survival and success .
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> bacteria who can survive to the heat of the <unk> that would produce , if there were fish there , fish accidents to a vacuum , yet , they 've made a welcoming environment .
So what does this , when we look at what 's happening in evolution in evolution , and if you start thinking about the place in human evolution in evolution , and in particular , if you look forward , the next phase -- ?
The first one is not <unk> .
We 've reached a kind of balance .
And the underlying reasoning that was underlying that through medicine , in the first place , we 've learned to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been dismissed and filled out of the population .
And secondly , as a species , we 've made our environment fit in , so that we adapt to it .
And by the way , we migrated , <unk> , and so it 's so much that it 's not possible , it 's not possible to have the isolation necessary to happen .
A second possibility is that there is a traditional traditional , traditional , natural , imposed on nature of nature .
And the argument here would be : that the gears of evolution roll , slowly , but they 're <unk> .
And in terms of isolation : as a kind of kind of <unk> planets going out there are going to be isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution .
But there is a third possibility , a attractive , intriguing , terrifying and terrifying .
I call it <unk> , new evolution , that it 's not simply natural -- but yaw and selected for us as individuals in the decisions we will make .
Now , how could this happen ?
How could we make this ?
First to consider the reality that many people are today , in some cultures , they 're making decisions from their offspring .
In some cultures , they 're choosing to have more males than women .
It 's not necessarily a good thing for society , but it 's about the individual and familiar level chooses .
Think of it also as possible to be able to choose not just sex with your offspring , but in your own body 's body making your genetic adjustments possible to cure or prevent disease .
What if we could make genetic change to remove the diabetes or Alzheimer 's or reduce the risk of cancer , or the stroke of the cancer ?
Would you not want to make those changes in your genes ?
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible .
The Human Genome Project in 1990 to 13 years .
<unk> <unk> millions dollars .
And the next year of being done , in 2004 , I could do the same job for 20 million months for three dollars .
Today , you can get a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at the cost of about 20,000 , and in a week than a week .
It 's not a lot of fun to actually make the human genome for 1,000 and getting more and more in the reach of all .
These changes .
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that we 're not just going to protect ourselves from themselves , but they 're going to induce immunity against other viruses .
Believe it or not an experimental trial in the ongoing flu vaccine cells in cells from a tobacco plant cells .
Can you imagine something good that comes out of tobacco ?
That 's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible .
Imagine then just a few other small changes .
Can you change the cells from their bodies , but if they could change the cells from their offspring ?
And if you could change the sperm and your eggs or change the <unk> egg opportunity and give your children a better chance of a healthier life , remove the diabetes , reduce the risk of cancer ?
Who does n't want any healthy kids ?
And then , that same analytical technology , that same engine , that same engine that can produce the changes to us is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> .
Why did n't have the ingenuity of a Ken Jennings if you could have the next generation of the next generation of computer Watson ?
Why do n't you have a <unk> muscle faster than allowed us to run faster and longer ?
Why not live more time ?
This is going to be compelling .
And when we are in conditions to pass this next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we would have , we will have the evolution of us before .
We 're going to take a process that normally you could take 100,000 years , and you can compress it at 1,000 years and maybe it 's going into the next 100 years .
These are elections that their grandchildren , or grandchildren of grandchildren are going to have them .
Are we going to use these options as well as posed options , a better <unk> society ?
Or , let 's selectively take different attributes that we want to make some of us , but not for others ?
Are we going to build a society that is more boring and more robust , and more maneuverable , or more maneuverable ?
This is the kind of question we 're going to have to face .
And most profound , we 're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these decisions decisions ?
For good or bad , and before you might think , these choices are going to depend on us .
Thank you .
Imagine a big bang when you 're at <unk> feet .
Imagine an airplane full of smoke .
Imagine a motor doing <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . It sounds frightening .
Well , I had a single seat that day . I was sitting in the <unk> .
I was the only one I could talk to you with the flight games .
So immediately I looked at them , and said , `` There are no problem . We probably hit some birds . ''
The pilot had already crossed the plane , and we were n't so far .
You could see the Manhattan .
Two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
The pilot <unk> plane with the Hudson River .
Mostly that 's not the road .
Let 's get the engines .
Imagine being on an airplane and no noises .
And then he said three words .
The three words I 've heard about .
He said , `` <unk> for the impact . ''
I did n't have to talk about the flight assistant .
I could see it in his eyes .
It was terror . Life was finished .
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day .
I learned that everything changes in a moment .
We have this list of stuff to do before they die , these things that we want to do in life , and I thought about all the people I want to do in life , and I did , all the fences that I did , and I did , all the fences that I did , and I did , all the fences I 've got .
While I was thinking about that later on , I was a phrase , `` I collect bad wine . ''
Because if the wine is ready , it 's going to open it up there .
I do n't know anything about life .
And that urgency is really changed my life .
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is the bridge by George Washington , that was n't very much for a lot -- I thought , wow , wow , I really feel a great deal .
I 've lived a good life .
In my humanity , and with my mistakes , I 've been trying to get better on all I did .
But in my humanity , I also give up to my ego .
And I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry I 've wasted the time that you did n't care with people that matter .
And I thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends with people .
And then , like <unk> on that , I decided to remove the negative energy from my life .
It 's not perfect perfect , but it 's a lot better .
In two years , I have n't had a fight with my wife on my wife .
It feels like wonders .
I 'm not trying to have a reason ; I 'll be happy .
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock goes <unk> , `` 15 , 14 , 13 . ''
You see the water <unk> .
I 'm saying , `` Please flies . ''
I do n't want this to break into 20 pieces as you see in those documentaries .
And while I was <unk> , I had the feeling of , Wow .
It 's almost like we 've been <unk> for all of our life .
But it was very sad .
I did n't want to go ; I love my life .
And that sadness are <unk> in a single thought , which is , I just wish one thing .
I wish I could see my children grow .
A month later , I was in a performance of my daughter , first grade , is not very much artistic talent -- yet ...
And for me , that was the whole reason for the world 's going to be .
At that point , I understood , these two points , that the only thing that matters in my life is a great parent .
For about all , the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent .
I made a miracle , you know , a miracle , you ca n't die .
And I was gave up the other gift that was the possibility of looking at the future and go back and live otherwise .
You 're flying today , the challenge that you can imagine the same airplane on your airplane -- and please not be like this -- but imagine , and how to change ?
What they would do , they still expect to do because they think they 're going to live forever ?
How do you change their relationships and negative energy in them ?
And most important , are the best parents that you can ?
Thank you .
Clearly , I 've clearly been blessed with many amazing projects .
But the most cool thing I worked on was this guy .
The guy calls <unk> .
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> of '80s .
One day he came home after running and said , `` Dad , I feel like , `` I feel clothes on my legs . ''
And that was the beginning of ALS .
Today , <unk> has total paralysis .
You can only use your eyes .
Her work influenced me .
I have a design company and animation company , , obviously , the graffiti thing is something we really admire and respect in the world of art .
So we decided we 're going to try to sponsor Tony , <unk> , and its cause .
So I went and met with her brother and father and said , `` Let 's give them this money .
What are you going to do with him ? ''
And his brother said , `` I just want to talk with Tony again .
I just want to be able to communicate with him , and he 'll be able to communicate with me with me . ''
And I said , `` A second is n't that you 've seen Stephen <unk> , not that all people with paralysis can be paralysis with through those devices ? ''
And he said , `` No , unless you 're an important person , you ca n't actually do it . ''
These devices are not affordable for people .
And I said , `` Well how do they communicate then ? ''
Did anyone see the movie `` The <unk> and the butterfly ? ''
They communicate that way , and they communicate it with your finger .
I said , `` That 's archaic . How can it be ? ''
So I introduced me to the only wish to deliver a check a check and instead signed a check that had no idea of how I was going to cover it .
I committed to her brother and father there at that precise moment , `` OK , this is the deal : Tony 's going to talk , we 're going to build a machine , we 're going to build a machine , and we 're going to find a way to make his art again .
Because it 's ridiculous that someone who is both in their inner ca n't communicate . ''
So I talked at a conference a couple of months later .
I met these guys , called `` <unk> Research Lab , '' which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface in any surface , and then , with a laser pointer , draw about it and recorded the negative space .
So they 're going through making installations like this .
All the things that appear , they say , are part of a life cycle .
They start with the sex organs , then with bad words , then with bad words , after the Bush , people start making art .
But there was always a cycle of life in their presentations .
And so it started on the journey .
And about two years later , about a year after a lot , after a lot and a lot of organization to move things from one side to side , we had a couple of things .
One , touch the doors of the insurance companies , and we got a machine that could be able to communicate , and a machine like Stephen Hawking .
Which was really cool .
And seriously , it 's the most fun thing ; I call it <unk> because I speak with the guy , you get an email from it , and you say , `` I do n't deserve a guy . This guy is fantastic . ''
The other thing we did was bring seven out of programmers from all over the <unk> world of all the <unk> to our house .
My wife , kids and I moved to the garage , and these hackers , and we moved to the computer back to the back of the house , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> them up the house .
Many of our friends thought we would make something completely stupid , and that when you would have had the pictures taken from the walls and in their place would have graffiti .
But for two weeks , we went to the sea of Venice , my son was a part , my dog also , and we create this .
It 's called <unk> and you can see the description .
They 're a couple of cheap Sun glasses that we bought in the Texas 's coat of copper in August Beach , some of <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
We take a <unk> camera , we open up , we open up on an LED light , and now there 's a device that is free -- and you put yourself in the software -- we published it ; we published code .
And we created a device that has no limitation at all .
There 's no insurance company saying , `` No . ''
There are no hospital I can say , `` No . ''
Any person with paralysis today , you have access to draw and communicate using just your eyes .
Thank you .
Thank you so much . That was awesome .
So at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
I love this picture because this is somebody 's room , and that 's his room .
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening .
And after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , intense sessions , intense sessions all night , Tony came back for the first time in seven .
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of her life 's support system , and it 's looking through the support system support system .
We ran the bed so I could see .
And we put a projector on a wall of the hospital outside of the hospital .
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you know , what was the feeling in the parking .
And the funny thing was that we had to take in the parking lot so we feel like , as if we were <unk> , the graffiti were too .
At the end of this , he sent us an email and this was what he said to us , `` This was the first time I draw in seven years .
I felt like he had been under the water and somebody finally came to me and he would take me out there so I could breathe . ''
Is n't that wonderful ?
And in a way , that 's our war .
That 's what keeps us moving , developing .
And we have a long way to go with this .
It 's a great device , but it 's the equivalent of a <unk> program .
Somebody with this artistic potential deserve much more .
So we 're trying to figure out how to do it better and make it faster and make it faster and robust .
Since then , we 've had all kinds of recognition .
We 've gained a lot of prizes .
Remember , it 's free ; none of us are making money with this .
Everything comes out of our own pockets .
The prizes were like , `` Oh , this is fantastic . ''
Armstrong tweeted something about us , and then , in December , Time magazine has recognized us as one of the <unk> inventions of 2010 , and it was really cool .
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that it is that in April of this year in the MOCA center , there 's going to be an exhibition called Art in <unk> .
And `` Art in <unk> '' is going to have the best <unk> urban art <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> all of them , will be there .
<unk> is going to be in the show of which it 's quite impressive .
So , basically , this is my idea : if you see something that is not possible , it 's possible .
None of what 's in this room , it was possible the stage , the computer , the computer , the microphone , nothing was possible at some point .
Do you know , anything in this room .
I 'm not a programmer , I 've never done anything with eye recognition technology ; I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen .
And these are the questions I want to do every single day when we 're going to find something that we have to do .
Thank you guys .
I 've spent the last few years <unk> in situations generally very difficult , and at the same time a dangerous way .
I went to prison -- I went to jail .
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
It stands to war and and hard and dangerous .
And I spent 30 days of eating just this -- fun at the beginning , very difficult in the middle , very dangerous , in the end .
In fact , in a large part of my career in a lot of my career in horrible appearance with the only goal of trying to look at social issues in ways that they 're going to look at social issues in ways that they 're interesting , and they 're kind of accessible to the audience in a way that they see them and accessible to the audience .
So when I knew I came here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands , and I wanted to do something a little different way .
So , some of you may have heard , or ago , a couple of weeks ago , I took up an award at <unk> .
I sent some messages on Facebook , some of Twitter , I offered it on behalf of the name of my TEDTalk from 2011 .
What was the next thing : `` <unk> your TEDTalk that you have no idea of what it 's about , and as content could be embedded in the face of the face that you 're about , and on the content I have to do it . ''
But said this , it 's a really good media opportunity . ''
You know how much people look at look at these TEDTalks ?
A lot .
It 's a degree in progress , by the way .
So even with that <unk> knew that someone was going to do the rights of name for the name .
If you had asked me a year ago , I would n't have asked you a year ago .
But in the new film that I 'm working on , we looked at the world of marketing , in advertising .
And as I said earlier , I 've been involved in horrible situations over the last few years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could do it , for something that was that difficult or so dangerous to get in the rooms with these guys .
You see , I had this idea for a movie .
Morgan <unk> : I want to make a film that I try to make a film that I tried to try and make advertising and advertising , and that all film you , and that all film you .
The film is going to call `` The largest ever <unk> '' .
What happens in `` The largest ever <unk> '' is all about that all up at the bottom , in end , in end , in end , has brand images , all the time from the title of the title .
Now this brand , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> Center .
These people were shooting at the shot in which it was going to do forever .
And so the film is exploring all this idea . ( Michael <unk> : It 's redundant . ) That 's a bit .
I 'm a flashlight . ( MK : I just say .
It was `` No . forever . ''
But we 're not just going to have the designer 's sponsor in the title -- we 're going to make sure any single categories that we could on the film .
Maybe we sell a shoe , and it turns the shoe 's most cool .
The most cool car that you 've ever led to , `` The largest ever ever <unk> , '' `` The largest ever <unk> <unk> <unk> . ''
<unk> <unk> : The idea is then then to show the brands , as part of life , making them what film the film film ? ( MS : And we actually show the whole film .
The goal of the film it is transparency .
You 'll see the whole process in this movie .
That 's the whole idea , the whole film , in principle in the beginning .
And I would love it to help us help make it happen .
Robert Friedman : You know , it 's funny because it 's the first time I hear that it 's the most respect for the audience . It 's the most respect for the audience . ''
<unk> : However , I do n't know how responsive is going to be people .
<unk> : You 've got a perspective -- I do n't know if `` angle '' is quite <unk> , but you know what 's going to happen ? ( MS : How does it happen ?
MS : A million and a half . ( D.C. : All right . ) John Kamen : I think it 's going to be hard the meeting with them , but certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big marks .
<unk> : Who knows , maybe for the moment that the movie comes out of the movie , let 's look like a lot of idiots .
MS : What do you think is going to be the answer ?
Stuart <unk> : Most of the answers will `` not '' .
MS : But it 's going to be hard about selling it , or being like it ?
JK : Both of these things .
MS : ... means you 're not very optimistic .
So do you help me ? I need help .
MK : I can help .
MS : All right . ( MK : Okay . ) Awesome .
MK : We have to think about what brands .
MS : Yeah . ( MK : That 's the challenge -- when you look at the people you have to treat ...
MK : We have some places where I go . ( MS : Okay . ) <unk> the camera .
MS : I thought , `` turn off the camera , '' meant having a conversation out of microphone .
<unk> the camera means `` we do n't want to know anything about your movie . ''
MS : And so , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappeared .
No wanted to have anything to do with this film .
I was surprised .
They did n't want to know anything with this project .
And I was very impressed ; I thought , the concept of advertising , to present the product as many people as possible as possible , to make so many people as possible .
Especially in the world today , this intersection of new media and old media , and the media scenario , is not the idea of that new vehicle worth of attention to the masses ?
No , that was what I thought .
But the problem was , you see , that my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this one mistake .
No , there was no mistake .
There was no mistake at all .
This would have been okay .
But the problem is what this image represents .
See , when you look for images of Google Google 's Google shows -- this is one of the first images that appear .
I like your way to roll , Sergey Brin . No .
This was the problem : transparency , free from simulation or deception ; easily detected , or you see it 's easily seen , and it easily understandable by the visibility or access to the visibility of business or the larger problem .
You see , we heard a lot about transparency in these days .
Our politicians name , the president , even the president , even the CEOs .
But all of a sudden , suddenly it 's kind of changes .
But why ? Well , transparency , day is scary -- like that 's a little bear that still still disappear .
It 's unpredictable -- like this weird rural path .
And it 's too risky .
What else is it risky ?
He was an entire bowl of <unk> <unk> .
That 's very risky .
When I started talking with companies , and I 'm telling you that we wanted to tell this story , and said , `` No , we want to tell you this story , and say , `` No , we want to tell your story stories .
We want you to tell a story , but tell me <unk> story . ''
See , when I was a kid and my father caught me in some lie -- and there 's him , and there he looked like it was three sides like he was saying , `` Son , you know , `` Son , there was three sides in every story .
There is your story , and there 's my story , and there 's real story . ''
As you can see , in this film , we wanted to tell the story .
But with only one company , one agency wants to help me -- and that just knew John Bond and Richard <unk> , I realized I would have to go on my own way , I 'd have to go through my own , and I would have to go on my own way , I would have to go off the intermediary and go to business and go to
So what I started to warn you suddenly -- and I started to give me what I started to give up with companies , is that when you start talking to me , you know , when you start a conversation with companies to understand your brand is a universal problem .
MS : I 've got friends who make big , huge , giant , and others who make little movies , independent , like mine .
And my friends who make big Hollywood , giant , say the reason that their movies have so much successful is because of the associated brands that their movies have so much .
And then my friends who do independent films say , `` Well , how are we supposed to compete with these large , giant movies , giant Hollywood movies , we 're going to compete with these big Hollywood movies , giant ? ''
And the film is called `` The largest ever <unk> . ''
How are we going to see specifically on the movie ?
Every time I get out , every time I open up my <unk> , you 'll see your bluegrass deodorant .
Now , at any time in an interview with someone else can say , `` Are you cool for this interview ?
Are you ready ? You get a little nervous .
I want to help you guys .
Maybe you should have a little bit of this before . ''
And there would offer one of these great grandchildren .
Both `` <unk> <unk> '' like `` Paradise <unk> , '' they 'll have their opportunity .
We 're going to have so much for male as for woman , solid , <unk> , on bar , like it .
That 's the general look .
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk> look at it .
Karen Frank : We 're a small brand .
It 's similar to the kind of smaller movies that you 've made ; we 're rather good <unk> .
So we do n't have the budget that have other brands .
So doing things like that , you know , you know , you 're the way , you know , people are the reason why this is for us .
MS : What words would they use to describe the Ki-moon ?
Bhutan is white .
KF : That 's a big question .
Volunteer : higher technology .
MS : Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put into the <unk> .
Man : We talk about a bold , cool thing .
I think `` cool '' is a great word that really puts this category in positive combat versus `` <unk> smell and sweat . ''
It keeps you cool .
How do you keep you fresh ? With better freshness , the more freshness , the three times .
Things like those who highlight the benefits .
MS : And that 's a dollar dollar .
What about me ? What 's a kind of common ?
I need to talk to man from the street , people like me , the ordinary <unk> .
They have to talk me about my brand .
MS : How do you define your brand ?
Man : Mmm my brand ?
I do n't know .
I like good clothes .
Woman : revive the '80s , I forget punk `` punk <unk> . ''
MS : Okay , what is the <unk> brand ?
<unk> : Number one . ( MS : One ) Man : I guess the kind of gender , the style I guess the type of gender , I guess .
I like a lot of dark colors , so many gray , many gray , and things like that .
And I usually wear like sun glasses , or I like the crystals and similar crystals like the crystals and similar .
Woman : If Dan was a classical <unk> , '' you could be Mercedes Benz . ''
Man 2 : The brand I 'm a <unk> .
Woman 2 : In part of <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , I do n't know .
Man 3 : I 'm the kind of pets .
<unk> toys for the country and pets in the country and the world .
So , I guess that 's my brand .
In my small sector , that 's my brand .
Man 4 : My brand is FedEx , because I commit the commodities .
Man 5 : <unk> <unk> Nation .
Is that something ?
<unk> : I 'm a lawyer .
Tom : I took .
MS : Well , we ca n't all be brand Tom , but often I 'm <unk> at the intersection of <unk> ' <unk> and casual <unk> .
I realized I needed an expert .
I needed someone who could go into my head , somebody who could help me understand what they call `` brand personality . ''
And I found a company called Olson by Pittsburgh .
They helped companies like <unk> , <unk> , Hallmark to discover that personality .
If they were able to do that for them , they could do it out for me .
<unk> : <unk> the photos , right ?
MS : Yeah . The first picture is a familiar picture .
A bit of : Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way .
MS : These things shape my way to see the world .
A : Tell me about that world .
MS : That world ? I think your world is the world you live in the world you live in -- your friends around you , your friends , your friends around you , your friends around you , your friends , your job you do .
All those things come from , and they start in a place , and in my case , they came from and start in my family , West Virginia .
A : What 's the next one that you want to talk about ?
MS : The next one was the best day of my life .
A : How does this relate to your thoughts , feelings and your way of being ?
MS : It 's like who I want to be .
I like the different things .
I like the weird stuff . I like the weird stuff .
A : Tell me about `` why '' -- what does that mean ?
What 's the machete ? What phase of <unk> is you find now ?
Why is it important <unk> ? What is the red ?
Tell me a little bit about that .
A little more than you , who are not who you are .
What other <unk> have you had ?
You do n't have to be fear . What kind of Russian rollercoaster is you ?
MS : <unk> ! ( A : Thank you . No .
A : Thank you for your patience . ( MS : Thank you . ( MS : Thank you very much . ) All right .
MS : Yes , I do n't know what 's going to come out of this .
There was a lot of madness about this .
<unk> <unk> : The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides , but complementary , in your brand personality -- brand Morgan <unk> .
It was very well together .
And I think there 's almost a paradox in them .
And I think that some companies only are going to lie in one of their strong strengths or each other , and in the other way to focus on both .
A lot of companies tend to do -- and it 's nature , to avoid the things that they 're not safe ; they 're trying to avoid fear , those elements , and you actually get them down to sink and make them come back and make it happen to be it .
What other brands are that ?
The first here is classical , Apple .
And you can see it also in Target , Wii , Mini of Mini <unk> and <unk> .
There are now playful brands and conscious brands , those things that have gone and come and come up with a <unk> brand is pretty powerful something .
MS : A <unk> . What is your brand ?
If someone asked you to do your brand identity , you personality , what would it be like ?
Are you a downward attribute , ? You 're somebody who makes blood flow ?
Or are you more good at a downward attribute ?
A little louder , reserved , conservative , conservative ?
The bottom-up attributes are like to be playful like `` <unk> , contemporary , adventurous , bold or bold , '' as <unk> as <unk> <unk> , profane or agile , profane , normal , magical or mystical , you like , you know .
Or are you more than attribute to descending attribute ?
Are you conscious , sophisticated , like you 're aware ?
You 're established , traditional , traditional , tweet ?
You 're reliable , stable , familiar , familiar , sacred , sacred , sacred , sacred , sacred or wise , sacred or wise , like ?
In the course of this film , we had more than 500 companies , bottom-up , they were saying , `` No , '' they did n't want to be part of this project .
They did n't want anything to do with this film , mainly because they did n't have control , they did n't have control over the product product .
We allowed ourselves to tell the story of the <unk> , and we got to tell the story in this movie of the movie , to identify the centers of the <unk> in this movie , to identify the centers of the desire centers in the brain so that we can identify the centers of the desire centers in the brain that 's so much for business marketing .
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising .
In the whole city for the last five years , there 's no billboards , there are no posters , there are no signage .
And we went to school school districts in which companies are going to be able to road schools schools in America .
So the amazing thing about me is that projects that I 've had the biggest answer , or that I have to be the ones that I 've interacted with things that I 've interacted with right .
And that 's what these marks .
<unk> <unk> , they took their agencies , and they said maybe these agencies do n't have my best interest in mind .
I 'm going to try directly with the artist .
I 'm going to work with him to create something different , something that 's going to challenge the people , who are going to challenge the way we look at the world .
And how has it gone ? Did you succeed ?
Well , from the film Festival in the Sundance , let 's take a look .
According to <unk> the film was released in January , and since then , this is not <unk> million , and then this film is n't <unk> .
This is just a <unk> period of two and a half weeks .
That 's just online -- no press , TV , TV .
The film still not <unk> .
It 's still not online . It 's not in <unk> .
It 's not even presented in other countries yet .
Ultimately , this film already has begun to win momentum .
And it 's not wrong , because almost all of the agencies that we talk about to tell their customers is not a part .
I 've always believed that if you risk , if you take risks , that in those risks there are opportunities .
I think when you get people out there , it 's pushing the failure .
I think when you train their employees at risk at risk is preparing your risk is preparing for rewards .
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to animate the people .
We need to encourage the people who are not afraid of the opportunities they can do .
Ultimately , let 's move forward , I think we need to give place .
We need to put that bear in a cage .
You 're afraid , you 're afraid .
From one thing at once , we need to embrace the risk .
And ultimately , we need to house that we need transparency .
Today , more than ever a bit of honesty is going to go through a long way .
And said this , with honesty , with honesty and transparency , all my talk `` <unk> , '' has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who who were $ purchased the rights of name on <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world .
<unk> presents the Transparency floor .
Thank you very much .
June Cohen : So , Morgan , in the name of transparency , which was exactly that there was exactly those $ apples ?
MS : It 's a remarkable question .
In my pocket , I have a check for the name of the TED matrix , the Sapling Foundation , a check check to be applied to be applied to my TED assistance next year .
The idea behind the I.T . wormhole is actually very simple .
We do n't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb .
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> <unk> plant in <unk> .
The gray boxes that you see are in real time systems .
If we 're able to engage these systems that control these systems that control and valves , we can cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
<unk> boxes do n't use Windows ; it 's a completely different technology .
But if we can put a cash of Windows of Windows in a laptop using an engineer to set up this gray box , then we 're ready .
This is the plan behind Stuxnet .
We started with a Windows <unk> .
The <unk> enter the gray box , damages the centrifuge , the Iranian nuclear program , is <unk> .
It 's easy , huh ?
I want to tell you how we discover this .
When we started to research on Stuxnet six months ago , the purpose was completely unknown .
The only thing you know is that it 's very , very complex on the Windows part -- the <unk> using multiple vulnerabilities .
It seemed like to do something with these gray gray boxes , these control systems .
So that struck us , and we started an experiment in which we infect our environment with Stuxnet and we saw what happened to this .
So they had very strange things .
Stuxnet actually was like a rat rat who did n't like our cheese : it smelled , but he did n't want to eat .
I did n't make sense for me .
And after I experience with different flavors of cheese , I realized , and I thought , `` This is a attack attack .
It 's completely driven . ''
The <unk> is actively searching in the gray box if they find a specific configuration , and even if the program he 's trying to infect it , it 's actually working in that place .
If no , Stuxnet does n't do anything .
So that called my attention , and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day , because I thought , `` We do n't know what the goal is . ''
It might be , say , for example , an American power plant , or a chemical plant in Germany .
Better than the goal , soon .
So we pulled out , and we found that it was <unk> in the attack of two digital bombs , a small one .
We also saw that they were very professionally armed by people that obviously had the internal information .
It 's all the points to attack all the points to attack .
You probably probably know how much the operator the operator sees .
So you know everything .
And if you 've heard that by Stuxnet 's <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the payload is very complex .
It 's very above all we 've seen before .
Here 's a sample of this code .
We 're talking about about 15 thousand lines of code .
It looks quite like the old language assembler .
I want to tell you how to make sense of this code .
What we were looking at at first calls was called function functions , because we know what they do .
And then we were looking at <unk> and we were trying to organize the real world structures , with potential goals of the real world .
We need behavioral theories that we can pass and pass .
In order to get to theories about goals , we remember that it 's definitely a violent <unk> , it must be a valuable white , and it 's certainly certainly located in Iran , because that is where most infections have been <unk> .
You do n't find several thousands of targets in that area .
It basically boils down to the nuclear plant power plant and <unk> <unk> .
So I said to my assistant , `` You know a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our customers . ''
I called them , and I 'll visit them in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data .
And it worked pretty well .
So we were able to associate with the little digital <unk> of rotor .
The rotor is that it 's a mobile part inside the centrifuge , the black object that you see .
If you run the speed of this rotor , speed up at the speed of this rotor , and they can certainly get the centrifuge explode .
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was , slowly , <unk> , <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest maintenance engineers , so that they could n't be solved very quickly .
And we 're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> watching very close to data and their structures .
So , for example , the number <unk> shows up in that code , you can not afford it .
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they 're a structured <unk> , and found that they are a structured <unk> .
That made sense , there was a coincidence .
And it became better yet .
These <unk> in Iran are split up in 15 parts called stages .
And guess what about the attack ?
This is almost identical structure .
So again , that was a good coincidence .
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands .
So there 's not misunderstanding : it was n't .
The results have been removed after several weeks of hard work .
normally <unk> dead ends , and we needed to start out .
Yet , we discovered that both digital , and they were pointed to one single target , but from different angles , but from different angles .
The little <unk> is taking a waterfall , and making the rotors and get it , and the big <unk> communicate with six waterfalls and manipulating valves .
And in sum up , we 're very confident that we 've determined what the intended recipient is .
It 's <unk> , and it 's just <unk> .
We should not worry that other goals are going to be used by Stuxnet .
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw , really shocked me .
There 's the gray box , and up you see the <unk> .
What this does is intercept the input values values for example of sensors and the sensors of vibration and vibration code and provides legitimate code , which I still run through the attack , with false data .
And believe it or not , these false inputs are <unk> by Stuxnet .
It 's like in Hollywood movies , the security chamber feeds the <unk> video <unk> .
It 's great huh ?
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the room .
It 's really much more dangerous and aggressive .
The idea is a digital security system .
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast .
For example , in a energy plant , when the big steam turbine is going on speed , you have to open an escape exhaust on a millisecond .
Obviously , you can not do it a human operator .
That 's where we need digital security systems .
And when they 're engaged , then they can pass bad things .
The plant can exploit it .
And we do n't care about <unk> , and you 'll notice it .
That scares that .
But it can be worse .
What I 'm going to say is very important .
Think about this . This attack is generic .
It has nothing to see , specifically , with <unk> , with uranium .
It could work also , for example , in a power plant , or in a automotive factory .
It 's generic .
And you do n't have -- as an attacker , to disseminate this load with a USB key , as we saw in the case of Stuxnet .
You could also use the conventional worms of the maggots worms .
It 's more possible .
And if you made that , with what it is with a massive mass destruction .
That 's the consequence we need to face .
Unfortunately , the most goals for such goals is not in the Middle East attacks .
It 's in the United States , and in Japan .
All of the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals .
We have to face the consequences , and so better that we 're starting to prepare now .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I 've got a question .
Ralph , it has been public in many sides that people assume that the <unk> is the main entity behind it .
What is your opinion ?
Ralph <unk> : Okay , really want to hear this ?
Yeah . Okay .
My view is that the <unk> is involved , but the engine is not Israel .
The engine behind this is cyber superpower .
There is one , and that 's the United States , fortunately , fortunately , fortunately .
Because , in another way , our problems would be even bigger .
CA : Thank you for <unk> . Thank you , Ralph .
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give you a <unk> skills , or another one that makes your wheelchair users get up and put it up . ''
In `` <unk> <unk> '' called these robots , exoskeletons .
They 're not different from something that 's put in the morning , it gives you a big force , which is also increasing its speed , and it helps you , for example , driving the balance .
It 's actually the actual integration of man and machine .
But not only that -- it can actually integrate it and connect it with the universe and other outside .
This is not an unreal idea .
To show you now in what we 're working on , we 're starting to talk about , we 're starting to talk about the American soldier who , on average , must take on their back a load of 45 pounds , and you 're forced to carry even more equipment .
Obviously , this leads to some important complications -- the injuries , in the 30 percent of soldiers -- with chronic damage .
We decided to contemplate this challenge , and to create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue .
So let me introduce you to <unk> Universal Human Rights .
Soldier : With the <unk> <unk> , I can carry 90 pounds of variables per piece of variables per year on .
Their flexible design , it allows you to put together and run up with tremendous agility and execute .
Let me tell you what I want to go , or where I want to go and go up my strength and get my resistance .
<unk> <unk> : We 're ready , with our industrial partner to produce this device , this new exoskeleton , this year .
I mean , it 's a reality .
Let 's go back at the <unk> users , what I feel particularly passionate about .
There are 68 million people , in chairs of wheels , worldwide .
It 's one percent of the total population .
And this is a really conservative calculation .
We talk about something that happens often , very young people , with damage to the spinal cord taking their life -- 20 , 30 , 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice .
We also talk about the population that we get out very quickly .
Their only choice , many times by brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair . <unk> . ''
And this has been like this for the last 500 years , since the successful dawn , as I should recognize .
So , we decided to start writing a new chapter of mobility about mobility .
So let me introduce you to the <unk> , who 's using Amanda <unk> who is a spinal injury , and as a result she could n't introduce you to 19 years , and now .
Amanda <unk> : Thank you .
EB : Amanda is using our <unk> , which I mentioned .
It has some sensors .
<unk> no invasive on the crutches who send signals to the computer the computer on board , here 's the back .
There is also some batteries that give the motors on the hips , and on the knees , and make it forward to this soft , very natural , very natural , very natural and very natural .
AB : I was 24 years old at the top of my life when , for a stranger in the air skiing down , <unk> was paralyzed .
In a fraction of a second , I lost all sensation , and all the motion of the pelvis .
Shortly after , a doctor walked into my hospital in the hospital , and he said , `` Amanda , you never walk walking . ''
That happened 19 years ago .
So it stole me up to the last little bit of hope of my self .
<unk> technology since then , it has allowed me to learn how <unk> costs down <unk> <unk> , climbing rocks and even ride bike .
But they have n't invented anything that allowed me to walk walking , until now .
Thank you .
EB : As you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit and talk with you .
It 's in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just by soldiers , but to Amanda , and all the wheels of chairs .
AB : Thank you .
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival .
It 's a place where women have the baton , practice sex to say hello , and the game is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious stuff .
And no , it 's not the <unk> Man festival or San Francisco .
Ladies and gentlemen and gentlemen , meet their cousins .
This is the world of the wild of rainforests in Congo .
The bonobos are , along with chimpanzees , their living relatives .
That means that we all share a common ancestry , an evolutionary grandmother , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
Now the chimpanzees are known for their aggression .
But unfortunately , we 've been too focused on this view in our narratives of human evolution .
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
Whereas the chimpanzees are dominated by the big , terrifying -- the Bonobo 's in charge of the women in charge of power .
These guys have created something special , because this leads to a very tolerant society where the lethal violence has n't been observed .
But unfortunately , the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes .
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> , and it 's been very difficult to look at them .
Congo is a paradox -- an extraordinary biodiversity of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the same -- the stage of a violent conflict that has been extended for decades , and caused nearly as many deaths as the First World War .
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger the Bonobo 's survival .
The <unk> of hunting meat and deforestation do n't be able to fill up and a stadium with the bonobos , and honestly , we 're not sure about it .
However , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear laughter hidden the trees .
Who are these cousins ?
We know them like the apes like `` make love , do not love the war , '' because they have frequent , <unk> sex , <unk> and bisexual sex issues .
And I 'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity , given that the Bonobo 's the problem of all of humanity 's problems .
At bonobos , like humans , they love to play the length of your life .
Play is not just a game of kids .
To us and for them , the game is fundamental to establish ties and encourage tolerance .
We learn to trust , and we learn the rules of play .
Play increases creativity and resilience , it has to look at the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of interactions , behaviors of connections .
And when you look at the Bonobo 's game , the Bonobo 's evolutionary roots , dance and human .
The game is the glue that unites us .
I do n't know what you play , but I want to show you a couple of unique videos , but I want to show you a few unique videos made from the wild .
First , it 's a Bonobo Bonobo 's game game , and I 'm not talking about football .
Here 's a female and a young male in the midst of a chase .
Look what she 's doing .
It could be the evolutionary origin of the sentence , `` He has <unk> . ''
I just think in this case , he loves it , right ?
Yeah .
So sexual game is common both in Bonobos such as in humans .
And this video is really interesting , because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the ingenuity of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> , and also how the game requires trust and promotes the confidence -- and at the same time , it 's more fun .
But the game is <unk> .
The game is <unk> , can take a lot of ways , some of which are more <unk> , imaginative , curious -- maybe the place where the wonder is going to be .
And I want you to see -- this is <unk> , a female young woman , who 's playing with water like that .
I think , like , we sometimes play alone alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner worlds and outside .
And it 's that playful curiosity that drives us to interact , and then the unexpected connections that we are formed are the real <unk> of creativity , we 're going to interact .
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobo 's , the Bonobo 's going to give us our own past and present .
But they also have a secret for our future , a future that we need to adapt to a increasingly difficult world more creativity and more and more cooperation .
The secret is that play the key of these capabilities .
In other words , the game is our <unk> adaptation .
To adapt to a success to a world that changes we need to play .
But will we get to the maximum our game capacity ?
The game is not frivolous .
The game is essential .
For bonobos and humans , life is not just cruel and ruthless .
When it looks at the least right to play , it may be the moment of the most urgent thing .
So , fellow primates , let us accept this gift of evolution , and play together while you 're treating creativity and friendship and wonder , wonder , creativity and friendship and wonder .
Thank you .
In New York City , I 'm responsible for a nonprofit , nonprofit organization called Robin Hood .
When I 'm not battling poverty , <unk> fires as a captain 's `` Captain <unk> <unk> . ''
And in our city , where volunteers , the volunteers , highly skilled who you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action .
I remember my first fire .
I was the second volunteer on the site , so I had a pretty high chance to go .
But still , there was a race to stand up against the other volunteers volunteers and figure out what was our task .
When I found the captain of the captain , he was a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life .
We were in high night , she was standing out in the rain , under an umbrella , in the pajamas were enslaved , on his head was on fire .
The other volunteer that I 'd just got there before , <unk> <unk> <unk> came first to the captain up to the captain of the house , and he asked her to go back and save the dog the owner of the house .
The dog ! Me was jealous . ''
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that , for the rest of his life , I would have to tell the people who entered a building on fire to save a live live only because he won me for five seconds .
Well , I was the next .
The captain made a <unk> .
He said , `` Bezos , I need between the house .
I need to go up , put up the fire , and bring it to this woman a couple of shoes . ''
I swear .
It was n't exactly what I was expected , at the end of the aisle , at the end of the aisle , the end of the hall , '' which was the <unk> firemen , '' which is at that height , kind of ended up off the fire , and he went into the fourth room , and he went into the fourth room , and he went
I know what you 're thinking , but I 'm not a hero .
It took my payload back to the staircase where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the front door .
We got out of the house treasures for the house where , as I was waiting , her treasure her treasure a lot more attention than mine .
A few weeks later , the department received a letter from the house owner by the brave effort to save her home .
Now , the kindness that she looked at about so much was that someone had reached a pair pair .
Both on my calling in Robin Hood , as in my vocation as a voluntary fireman I 'm a witness of acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but also acts of grace as a fireman I 'm going to volunteer .
And you know what I 've learned ?
Everything has its importance .
So , when I look at the people in this room that they 've achieved , or they 're to get them , remarkable levels of success , I 'd like to remind you , do n't wait .
Do n't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody 's life .
If you have something to give , let me get you now .
You ate food in a dining hall .
They 're mentors .
Not every single day we 're going to have the opportunity to save someone 's lives , but every day we can influence someone 's life .
So they trained the game , put it in the shoes .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Mark , Mark , comes back .
Mark Bezos : Thank you .
This may seem strange , but I 'm a big fan of concrete block .
The first concrete blocks is built in 1868 a very simple idea : a cement modules of a very simple sense , kind of concrete modules that fit together .
Very quickly , these became the most used building unit in the world .
They have allowed us to build larger things that we , like buildings or bridges , a brick at the time .
Essentially , these blocks have become the pillars of our time .
Almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , hats came up with this .
He was called the automatic assembly machine .
And in a few years , the incubator bricks got to all the homes .
It 's estimated that they 've made over 400 billion or 75 million building 75 blocks per person on the planet .
You do n't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges , buildings or houses .
Similar made it accessible .
x , I just adopted the concrete block of the concrete block in the world , it became a fundamental piece of our imagination .
Meanwhile , exactly that same year , at Bell laboratories , the next revolution was about <unk> : the new block of building .
The transistor was a small small unit of plastic that would take us from a static building up piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive .
Just like the concrete block , the transistor allows , to create a much greater circuits and more complex , a brick at the time .
But there is a main difference : the transistor was only experts .
I personally do n't accept it , that the building blocks of our time are safe to experts , so I decided to change it .
Eight years ago , when I was at the Media Lab , I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers , and I started to explore the idea of artists and the hands of artists and designers .
A few years ago , I started developing <unk> .
I 'll show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function .
They 're <unk> to be light , and sound , motors and sensors .
And the best thing is come together through magnets .
So you ca n't put it in a wrong way .
The bricks have a color code .
The green is the way the output , the blue is the entrance and the orange color , is the wire .
So you just assemble a blue one very quickly and very quickly you can start to make older circuits .
A blue one with a green one produce light .
We can put a button in the middle and we have a regulator .
If we change the button for a pulse of pulse , it 's here , and now we have a <unk> light .
So , you know , this timbre to create more impact , and we have a noise machine .
I 'm going to stop this .
So beyond the simple game , <unk> are actually really powerful .
Instead of having to program , connect and screw , allow us to program it allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
To make you blink faster or slower , it 's just turning this button faster or slower .
The idea behind <unk> is that it 's a growing collection .
We want all the interactions in the world to get bricks together to bricks to use .
<unk> , <unk> , solar panels , solar panels , it all have to be accessible .
We 've been given to the kids to get them playing with them .
And it 's been an amazing experience .
The best is how you start to understand the electronics of every day you do n't learn in schools .
For example , how a light is working at night , or why the elevator 's door remains open , or how an iPod responds to you open up open .
We also have led to the design schools .
So , for example , designers without experience in electronics , they start playing with <unk> as a material .
Here you can see , with paper bottles and felt , we have <unk> , creating ...
And a few weeks ago , we took a Rhode Island to the Rhode Island School designers in Rhode Island 's <unk> , just in cardboard and wood and we said , `` Make something .
Here 's an example of a project that they 've done , a bow canyon , activated wreck , movement .
But wait , here 's my favorite project here .
It 's a made out of dough that 's made fear of darkness .
For these no engineers , <unk> became another material , electronics became another material .
And we want this material for the reach of all .
So , <unk> has open source .
You can visit the website , download all the design files , design all the design files and scratch . ''
We want to encourage a world of creators and inventors and collaborators , because this world we live in , this interactive world we live in , this interactive world .
So go ahead and invent .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk to you today about the discoveries .
I work in the solar industry .
And my little company , is to engage with focusing on the environment .
<unk> collaboration .
This is a small video of what we do .
Uh . Wait for a moment .
You can take a little bit of it .
We can -- we can continue to leave the video on the side .
No .
This is not ...
All right .
The solar technology is ...
Oh , I 've got a term time ?
All right . Thank you .
A couple of years ago , I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and work in an environment for a year , to work in a year , to work in an environment that represents almost everything they 're supposed to do .
The initiative was called <unk> for America , and it would be like a <unk> of Peace Peace .
We raised some members every year and we put them working with municipalities .
Instead of sending them to the Third World , we send them to the wild world .
They made big applications ; they worked with municipal employees .
Your task is to show the possibilities of current technology .
You meet Al .
This is a city hydrant in Boston .
Here it shows up as if I could look a date , but what it really looks for is that someone will have to clean up when it 's caught up in the snow trapped because it 's not very good at turning fires when it is covered by a meter in snow .
How did it come to ask for help in this particular way ?
Last year , we had a team of members for America . ''
They were there in February , and at that time , a long year ago .
They realized that the city has never wiped out these fire hydrants .
But one of the members of the members called Erik noticed something else : that citizens are going to take off the sidewalks with shovels up right in front of them right in front of them .
And so he did like any good programmer , I developed an app .
It 's a nice application where you can take a fire hydrant .
You accept cleaning up when you 're going .
When you do so , you put a name on it , in this case , put it Al .
If you do n't , someone can do it .
I mean , it has a playful .
It 's a modest application .
It may be the smallest part of the 21st year applications that last year is the past year .
But it does something else that no other technology is achieved .
And it goes viral .
A lot of systems responsible for the City of Honolulu City systems by seeing this app realized that it was able to use it , not for the snow , but for the citizens to get Sirens to Sirens .
It 's very important that you work these Sirens Sirens , but people steal the batteries .
That 's why it asks the citizens to monitor .
And then Seattle decided to use it just to make the citizens put up blindfolded .
And Chicago , he just threw it out to get people in order to get people in order to clean sidewalks in sidewalks when they 're <unk> .
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use .
And this has spread without friction , so it 's natural and natural .
If you know a little bit of government technology , you will know that this does n't normally happen .
So , software acquisition is usually a couple of years .
So last year in Boston , we had a team working on a project that took three and a half months .
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children .
Then they told us that it would have done by normal channels it would have taken at least two million years and cost about two million dollars .
And that 's nothing .
Now there 's a project in the judicial power project of California that the time has cost up , 2000 , and it does n't work .
And there are projects like this in every level of government .
So an app which is a couple of days in a couple of days and it 's a viral luck to the institution of the government .
It suggests to the government better ways to work , not as in private companies , as a lot of people in private enterprises , as many people think should be .
It 's also not like a technological company , but rather than the same Internet .
I mean , without constraints , in form open and generative .
And that 's important .
But the most important thing about this application is that the way to address the question of the government is that it 's a new generation , not as a problem of an institution of an institution .
And that 's very good because it turns out we 're very good for collective action with digital technology .
And there 's a very large community of people who are building tools so that work with efficacy of efficacy .
And it 's not just <unk> for America , but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to civic applications every day in their own communities .
You have n't given up with government .
They have a great sense of frustration to that , but they do n't complain , fix it .
And these people know something we 've lost from sight .
And that is , if we leave the feelings of politics , the <unk> line in <unk> -- and all of those other things that are you who put us crazy , the government is , essentially , in Tim 's words : `` What we do together , because you ca n't . ''
Now , a lot of people have abandoned the government .
If you 're one of those people , you would ask them , it 's because things are changing .
Politics do n't change ; the government does .
And because the government ultimately comes out of us -- remember that from `` We , the people ? How about this will affect the change , '' the way to produce change .
I did n't know a lot about government when I started with this .
And as a lot of people , I thought that the government was to pick up people in order to take charges .
Well , after two years I 've come to the conclusion that the government is , especially , about <unk> .
This is the healthcare center of services and services .
It 's the place that serves the calls if you mark it on the United States .
Scott <unk> this call .
He checked , `` <unk> '' at the basis of official knowledge .
I did n't find anything . He started with animal control .
And he finally said , `` Hey , you can open the house out of the house , I 'll put the music good and see if it 's going ? ''
And it worked . So by Scott .
But that was n't the end of the <unk> .
Boston does n't have a call center .
It has an application , web and mobile , called <unk> <unk> . ''
You do n't want that application .
It was the work of very intelligent people from the Office of Boston <unk> in Boston .
One day , this really happened , and this asked , `` You know , you 're <unk> in my garbage . I do n't know if it 's dead .
How do I do the leave ? ''
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different .
Scott was talking to person .
And in <unk> <unk> is all public , so you can all see this .
In this case , he saw a neighbor .
And the next report said , `` I came to the room , I found the bucket of the garbage behind . ''
Do you know ? Yes . lived ? Yes .
He gave the cube . I went home .
Good evening , sweet nights . ''
Pretty simple .
This is great . That 's the confluence of digital , and physical .
And it 's also a great example of the government 's income of government 's worth distributed .
But it 's also a great example of government as a platform .
And here I do n't necessarily mean by the tech platform .
I 'm talking about a platform for people to go out and help others .
So , a citizen helped that one , but here the government had a key role to it .
connected the <unk> to two people .
And it might be connected to the government services to be necessary government services , but neighbor is a better new alternative and cheaper utility than government services .
When one neighbor to help another one , they will undermine the communities .
If we call animal control , that costs a lot of money .
One important thing that we have to think about government is that it 's not the same as politics .
A lot of people understand it , but think you 're the entrance to another .
That our entrance to the government system is the vote .
How many times have you just chosen a political leader , sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that government reflects our values and <unk> our needs .
That 's because the government is such a huge ocean , politics is the surface surface surface .
So it 's what we call bureaucracy bureaucracy .
And we say that word with a lot of contempt .
But that 's that contempt what keeps us that it belongs to us that we funded as something that it 's going to operate in our against , that 's one thing , and a consequence we 're losing the power .
People believe that politics is sensual .
If we want this institution to work , we 'll have to make the sensual bureaucracy .
Because that 's where the real government is happening .
We need to collaborate with the government of government .
That does the <unk> movement .
Have you ever seen them ?
It 's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report of 325 pages an answer to <unk> <unk> at the financial reform project of financial reform .
That 's not political activism is not political activism .
And for whom we 've been faced with the government , it 's time that we want to ask for the government , we want to leave to leave our children .
You have to see enormous challenges that they will have to face .
Do you really believe that we have to go where we have to go and do n't solve the institution that can act on behalf of all ?
We ca n't without government , we need to be more effective .
The good news is that with technology , it 's possible to root the root function of ways that it can expand the government 's function so that it can expand that civil society .
There 's a generation that grew up with the Internet and you know it 's not so hard to act , but you only have to articulate the systems of the right shape .
The age of 20 members of our members is 28 years old , so many of them .
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and doing that almost for granted .
They 're not giving that battle that we all face about , and they 're going to talk .
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and doing it .
So when you face the problem of government , they do n't care a lot about to hear their voices .
They 're using hands .
They put their hands on the work to program applications better to work government .
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
It can be cleaning up a fire hydrant , taking off weeds and dumping a bucket of garbage into a garbage inside .
Of course , we always could have cleaned up those fire hydrants and lots of people do .
But these applications are like a digital fingerprint that we 're not only only consumers , we are not only government consumers who pay taxes .
We 're more than that : we are citizens .
And we 're not going to fix the government until we do n't care about .
So I want to ask everyone here , when it comes to the important things that we have to do together , all together , we will be a crowd of voices , or we will be a crowd of voices ?
Thank you .
This is to me a real honor .
I 've spent most of the time in jails in prisons , prisons and death row of death .
I 've spent most of my life in <unk> communities , in projects and places where there 's a lot of despair .
And to be here at TED and you hearing this stimulation , it has given me much energy .
One of the things I 've noticed in this short time , is that TED has identity .
And the things that are telling here , they have impact around the world .
Sometimes , if something comes from TED , it makes a sense and a force that would n't have otherwise .
I mean , because I think identity is important <unk> .
Here 's fantastic presentations .
And I think we 've learned that the words of a professor can make a lot of sense , but if they teach them with feeling , they can have a special meaning .
A doctor can do good things , <unk> if it 's <unk> , it can get much more .
So , I want to talk about the power of identity .
I did n't really learn this in the practice of the right , my job .
I learned it from my grandmother .
I grew up in a traditional American family from dominated by a matriarch , which was my grandmother .
It was hard , it was strong , and it was empowered .
It was the last word in the family .
She started a lot of the <unk> in our home .
He was a daughter 's daughter 's daughter .
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia .
She was born about the 1880 and his experience with exhibited slavery in the way the way the world saw .
She was hard , but she was also loving .
When I was a little bit small and looked at , she was approaching me and I gave a good hug .
I became so strong so I could barely get it away , and then dropped me off .
One or two hours later , I went back to look at it , I was approaching myself and said , `` <unk> , you still feel my hug ? ''
And if I read it , he grabs me again , and I said yes , I was leaving peace .
I had this quality human quality that I want to always want to be close with .
The only problem is I had 10 children .
My mother was the least 10 .
Sometimes , when I was going to spend a time on her , it was n't easy to pick up their time and their attention .
My cousins were running everywhere .
I remember when I was eight nine years old , I woke up the morning , and I went into the room , and I ran all my cousins .
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me .
At first I thought I was a game .
So he looked at her and she smiles , she smiles , she was very serious .
After 15 20 minutes , she got me up , and he went up the room , and he took me out of her hand and she said , `` You see <unk> . The two will go . ''
I remember this like yesterday .
I 'll never forget it .
He took me out , and he said , `` You know , I 'll tell you something , but you ca n't tell anyone . ''
I said , `` Okay , Mama . ''
She said , `` Now let me not do it . '' I said , `` Oh , `` Sure . ''
And then I sat down , and she looked at me and said , `` I want you to know that I 've been watching you . ''
And he said , `` I think you 're special . ''
He said , `` I think you can do whatever you want . ''
I 'll never forget it .
Then he said to me , `` I just want to give you three things , <unk> . ''
I said , `` Sure , Mama . ''
And he said , `` The first thing I want to tell me is you always want to want your mother . ''
<unk> : `` She 's my <unk> , and you 've got to argue that you 're always going . ''
As I loved my mom , I said , I said , `` Yes , Mom , I 'm going . ''
Then he said to me , `` The second thing I want to do is you 're always going to do the right thing , but the right thing is the hard thing . ''
I thought , and I said , `` Yeah , I know , Mama . So I 'm going . ''
Then , finally he said , `` The third thing I want to tell me is that never <unk> alcohol . ''
I was nine years old , and I said , `` Yeah , `` Yes , Mama , I will . ''
I grew up in the field , in southern South . I have a older brother and a sister a year lower .
When I was 14 15 , one day my brother got home with a packet of six beers , I do n't know where he brought up my sister and caught up my sister and went up and we were up for the forest .
We just came up with each other forever .
He took a sip of beer , offered my sister a little bit and offered me .
I said , `` No , no , no . All right . You 're going follow , but I 'm not going to take beer . ''
My brother said , `` Come on . Today you 're going . And you 're always the same . ''
I already took something , your sister too . Take a beer . ''
I said , `` No . I did n't feel good . You can follow . ''
Then my brother looked at me at staring at me .
And he said , `` What happens ? Take a beer . ''
And he went up the way , and she went on , `` Ah , not to be that you 're still thinking about the conversation with Mama . ''
I said , `` But what are you talking about ? ''
He said , `` Mama he tells all of grandchildren who are special . ''
I got broken .
I have to admit something to you .
I 'll tell you something that probably should n't say .
I know this spread widely .
But I 'm 52 years , and I can admit that I never have a drop , and I can admit that I 've never taken a drop of alcohol .
I do n't think this thinking is a virtue ; I mean by the power of identity .
When we create the right type of identity , we say things to really do n't see it .
We ca n't get to do things that they do n't believe .
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special .
My grandfather had a jail for the ban .
My uncles died of age-related diseases .
And these were the things that , according to her , we had to engage .
Now , I 'm trying to talk about our criminal justice system .
This country is very different from what it was about 40 years ago .
There was 300,000 300,000 prisoners .
Today there are 2.3 million .
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world .
We have seven million people in probation make .
And this massive incarceration , in my opinion , has fundamentally changed our world .
In poor communities or black , it 's so much despair , so much despair , a given by these facts .
One in three black people between 18 and 30 years is in jail or 30 years old is in jail or <unk> .
In the urban <unk> of the entire country , Los Angeles , in Philadelphia , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Washington , for 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 percent of the color young people in jail are in jail or parole .
Our system is not just distorted in the course of the race .
In this country , we have a judicial system that is a lot better if you 're rich and guilty , that if you 're poor and innocent .
It 's not guilt , it 's wealth wealth .
And it seems to be very quiet .
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not problems .
We 're disconnected with .
It seems interesting .
We 're looking at our work some pretty curious experiments .
In my state , in Alabama , in Alabama , as well as in other states , they were always going on rights as well if you have a criminal prison .
Right now in Alabama , 34 percent of black male population has definitely lost the right to vote .
And if we projected it to the next 10 years , the level of rights loss to be as high as it was before the law of the voting law to vote .
We have this impressive silence .
I represent children .
Many of my customers are very young .
The United States is the only country in the world where it was sentencing kids 13 from 13 years to die in prison .
We have this prison country for kids , no possibility of getting out .
Right now we 're in the process of some litigation .
The only country in the world .
I play people in the death row .
This issue of death penalty issue is interesting .
Now , in a sense , you 've got to think that the final question is , people are going to think that the final question is , people are going to be killed by the final question ?
Very sensitive question .
But you can think of another way about how we 're in our identity .
There 's another way of looking at it , it 's not trying to decide that people are going to die by crimes in physical crimes , but if we deserve to kill .
This is interesting .
The death penalty sentence is defined by error .
In every nine hundred people , one which has identified that it 's <unk> and released from the death row of the death row , which has been identified and released from the death row of each nine .
A mistake of error , amazing , an innocent fall in nine .
This is interesting .
In aviation , it was n't allowed to never ever fly airplanes if they would take off , one would have crashing .
But somehow we cut the problem .
It 's not our problem .
It 's not our charge .
It 's not our struggle .
I 'm talking a lot about these things .
I 'm talking about race and this issue of if you deserve to kill .
It 's interesting that in my classes with students about African-American history , I 'm talking about slavery .
I talk to you about terrorism , the time that it started at the end of the rebuilding of the reconstruction of World War II .
We really do n't know a lot about this .
But for the black Americans in this country , it was a time defined by terror .
In many communities , people were afraid of being <unk> .
They were worried about being bombarded .
The threat of terror threat was what defined its lives .
Now there are older people who come to me and tell me , `` Mr Stevenson , you 'll tell you it teaches talks . You 'll talk to the people that are telling talks .
They ask me to say , `` No . Say , we grew up with that . ''
The age of terrorism went on , obviously , with segregation and decades of race and of separation .
In this country we have a dynamic because we do n't like to talk about our problems .
We do n't like to talk about our story .
And that 's why we have n't understood the meaning of what historically .
All time <unk> with each other .
We constantly create tensions and conflict together .
It costs us work to talk about races . I think , because we 're not willing to engage with a really true truth and reconciliation process .
In South Africa , people understood that they could not overcome racial apartheid without a compromise with truth and reconciliation and reconciliation .
In Rwanda , even before the genocide had this commitment , but in this country we have n't done .
I was in Germany by giving lectures on the death row .
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation , and said , `` You know , you know it 's well worrying about what you say . ''
<unk> : `` We do n't have death row in Germany .
Now , we 'll never be able to get it here . ''
The room stood in silence and a lady said , `` There is no way with our history , we can never get into the systematic death of human beings .
It would be irrational that we , intentional and deliberately , we put people . ''
Let 's talk about it .
How would we feel in a world where a nation like , in the world , did it , especially if they were in their Jews , especially Jews ?
We could not tolerate it .
It would be irrational .
And yet , there 's this disconnect .
I think our identity is in danger .
If we do n't really care about these hard issues so hard , positive , positive , positive , positive , involved .
We love innovation .
We 're fascinated . It 's creativity .
We love entertainment . We love entertainment .
But lately , those realities are <unk> by suffering , abuse , <unk> <unk> .
In my opinion , you need to integrate both things .
lately , we talked about the need to have more hope , more engagement , more commitment , of the basic challenges of the basic challenges of this complex world complex .
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor , <unk> , the <unk> , which we never come to TED .
Think of it , in a way , something that 's inside your self .
We really need to believe that we have n't seen .
That 's what we are , despite being so rational , committed to intellectual .
The innovation , the development . development .
These things come from enrichment ideas as also for convictions convictions .
This connection of mind with heart mind is what drives us up not just as brilliant and dazzling , but also the dark and hard .
Oceans <unk> , the great Czech leader was talking about this .
He said , `` When we were in Eastern Europe suffering , we wanted all sorts of things , but mainly what we needed was most things , but mainly what we needed was hope for the spirit , a will for the spirit , a willingness to be sites of hopelessness and to be witnessed . ''
Well , that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think even in communities like TED , you have to engage it .
There is no disconnect related to technology and design , which allows us to truly be human , if we do n't pay care of it , if we do n't pay attention to injustice .
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we 're ignoring these things .
We go back to them .
I had the great privilege , being a very young lawyer , to meet Rosa Parks .
These women were together simply to talk .
Occasionally , the <unk> lady called me , to say , `` <unk> , '' `` <unk> ! '' We 're going to gather it up to speak .
Do you want to come and listen ? ''
I would say , `` Yes ma'am . I know . ''
So she said , `` Well , what do you do when you come ? ''
I answered , `` <unk> . ''
So I was going and just listening the listening .
It was very <unk> , very <unk> .
And in one occasion , I was listening to these ladies , and after a couple of hours , Ms. Parks , Ms. Parks , Ms. Parks and said , `` Now , let me get me out , tell me that is that idea of justice . ''
Tell me what you 're trying to do . ''
And I began to give my speech .
I said , `` Well , we 're trying to question the injustice .
We try to help the people who have been doomed unfairly .
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination and discrimination in the criminal justice management .
We try to end the life for life , without parole for children .
We try to do something about that death penalty .
We try to reduce the population in the prisons .
We try to end up with massive <unk> . ''
I gave my whole best speech and he looked at me and said , `` Mmm mmm . ''
And he said , `` They 're exhausted , very exhausted . ''
At that moment , Mrs. <unk> went on , and he put my finger on his face and said , `` This is why you have to be very brave , very brave . ''
I think , actually , the TED community has to be a lot more <unk> .
We need to figure out how to address those challenges , those problems , that suffering .
Because finally , humanity depends on compassion for others .
I 've learned some very simple things in my work .
I 've been educated in simple things .
I 've come to understand , and to believe that each of us is superior to the worst we 've made .
I think that 's true for everybody on the planet .
I 'm convinced that if someone says a lie , it 's not because you 're a deceptive .
I 'm sure if somebody takes something that belongs , it 's not that it 's a thief .
Even if someone kills another , it 's not a killer .
So , I think there 's a basic dignity of people that have to be respected by the people who have being respected .
I also think that in many parts of this country and , certainly , in many parts of the world , the opposite of the world , the opposite of poverty is not the wealth .
It 's not .
I really think in many parts of the opposite parts of poverty is justice .
And finally , I think , even though very dramatic , very beautiful , very beautiful , very stimulating , we do n't know how our technology is , our technology , for our design or intellectual capacity .
Ultimately , the character of a society is judging the character of a society , not how they treat rich , powerful , powerful , privileged people , people , people .
Because it 's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are .
Sometimes I feel <unk> . I 'm going to end with a story .
Sometimes I do too much force .
<unk> tired , like everyone .
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my stories in a important way .
I 've been representing these kids who have been convicted of <unk> .
I go to jail , and I see my clients of 13 and 14 years of 13 , which have been <unk> as adults as adults .
And I start thinking , how can it be ?
How can a judge a judge out how someone is not ?
The judge is <unk> as an adult , but I see a child .
And one night , very late night , thinking about God , if the judge , the judge can become something that you 're not , must have magical powers .
Yes , <unk> , the judge has magical powers .
You should ask for something about that .
As I was late , I could n't think of myself , but I started working on a <unk> .
I had a 14-year-old client , a little black , black .
I started working on <unk> , with a <unk> saying , `` <unk> for my 14-year-old black client was treated as a <unk> white <unk> of a corporation executive in a corporation . ''
In the <unk> , I started that there had been focusing on the accusation , in the police , the police behavior and the process .
There was a bold line on how in this country there is no ethical , but a lack of ethics .
Now , the next morning , I woke up with that <unk> , would be a dream , would it be a dream , or I wrote it ?
For my horror , not only had it , it was n't just <unk> , but he had sent it to court .
It took about two months , I had already forgotten it .
And finally I decided -- `` Oh my God , I have to go to court for this case stupid . ''
I got into the car and I felt really overwhelmed , overwhelmed .
I went in the car to court .
I thought this would be very hard and pathetic .
I finally got off the car . I walked to court .
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man , and it was the court of the court .
When he saw me , he came up to me and said , `` Who is you ? ''
I said , `` I 'm a lawyer . '' He replied , `` It 's you . '' I said yes .
And so , I went up and stood up to me .
And I whispered into my ear .
He said , `` I 'm proud of you . ''
I have to tell you now that was <unk> .
So that really connected connected to my inner identity with the ability we all need to contribute into the community with an hope vision .
Well , I came into the audiences .
When you go in , the judge , the judge .
And he said to me , `` Mr. Stevenson , you . You wrote this bold <unk> ? ''
I said , `` Yes , `` Yes , I was like , `` Yes , '' and we 're starting .
People started coming up . They were all upset .
I was writing that I had written those crazy .
You get the policemen the <unk> the <unk> <unk> policemen .
Suddenly , without knowing how to , the room was full of people . All furious , because we were talking about races , because we talked about race poverty , because we were talking about race poverty , because we were talking about inequality .
With the <unk> eye on the eye , he 's going and came to see the likes and he came .
I would look out on the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk> .
I walk here and so on .
Finally , this old black woman face in the room and sat behind me in the room and sat behind me at the lawyers .
About 10 minutes after , the judge is a break .
And during the break a <unk> assistant , he showed because he was in the room in the room .
The assistant <unk> over the old black man .
And he said , `` Jimmy , what do you do in the audiences of audiences .
And the old black man stood up , looked at the assistant , looked at me and said , `` I walked into the audiences of audiences to tell this young young man who maintain her view in the target target . ''
I 've come to today TED , because I think many of you , you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large , but it folds towards justice .
That we ca n't truly be truly human , if we do n't care for human rights and not care about human rights and for dignity .
That our survival is connected to the others .
That our visions of technology , design , entertainment , entertainment , entertainment , entertainment , entertainment , entertainment , entertainment .
And above all the people that you have to share this , I just want to tell you , keep your view in the target and sort of sort of <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : You just hear and see an obvious desire in the audience , to help some of the purposes of helping the audience , do something .
Something that 's not a check . What can we do ?
<unk> : There are various opportunities close .
If you live in the state of California , for example , there will be a <unk> <unk> in which you 're going to make an effort to provide the funds that are spending today on punishment .
For example , here in California , you 're going to spend a billion dollars on the death penalty next to the next five years , one billion dollars .
And despite this , 46 percent of homicide are not <unk> in arrests .
56 percent of rapes do nothing .
Here 's a change opportunity .
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds , making the funding of the law , to make the security .
I think there 's a very close opportunity .
CA : There 's been a huge decline in crime in the U.S. in the last three decades .
Part of the explanation , it 's called the highest incarceration .
What would you say what you think is this ?
<unk> : Actually , the crime crime rate has remained relatively stable .
The big growth of mass incarceration in this country is not by crimes with violence .
It 's the wrong War on drugs .
That 's why this dramatic increase in prison population .
And let us convince ourselves by the rhetoric .
We have three legal sources to bring people to business chain , by stealing a bicycle , small crime crimes , instead of making a bicycle of those resources to their victims .
I think we need to make the victims of the <unk> and not less .
It seems like our philosophy today about punishment does nothing for anybody .
I think that 's the orientation that has to change .
CA : <unk> , you know , you 've been excited about it here .
You 're very inspiring .
Thank you very much for TED coming to TED . Thank you .

Oh , my God !
Peter Diamandis : This is just some clips that I got in the last six months , <unk> , could be the last six days or the last six years .
The idea is that media is prefer <unk> news because our minds are paying attention .
And that responds to a very good reason .
In every second of our senses , our senses will get a lot more data than probably the brain can actually process .
And like nothing really matters to us to survive , the first stop of all of this data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
The amygdala is our early warning detector , the danger detector .
<unk> and records all the information is looking for something in the environment that could make us damage .
And so from a <unk> stories to look at the negative stories .
That old adage saying : `` If there 's blood , it sells , it 's very true .
And because of all the digital devices give us the negative news , the seven days of the week , 24 days a day , 24 hours a day , no wonder we 're going .
It 's not surprising that people think that the world 's going to think the world 's going on wrong .
But maybe not like this .
Maybe , instead , what really happens is we get <unk> .
Perhaps the huge progress that 's done in the last century for a series of forces is accelerating in such a way that we have the potential to create a world of abundance of the next three years by the next three decades .
Now , I 'm not saying that we do n't have our good problems : climate change , endangered species , water scarcity , most of them .
As humans , we 're very good at taking the problems , and in the long time , we just have them .
Let 's look at the last century to see where we go .
In the last hundred years , the average life has more than doubled , average income per capita income , for inflation , has tripled .
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times .
Also , the cost of food , from electricity , from transportation and communications , has fallen 10 to 1,000 times .
Steve Pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history .
And Charles preference that the world literacy of the world 's 25 to more than 80 in the last 130 years .
We 're really living an extraordinary time .
A lot of people forget it .
And we keep giving ourselves increasingly .
In fact , we redefine the meaning of poverty .
Think about it , today , much of the United States , a lot of the people who live under the poverty line , have electricity , water , bathrooms , refrigerators , television , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile phones . ''
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the planet would never be dreamed of such luxuries .
You know a lot about this is technology , and lately , its exponential growth .
My good Kurzweil Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we 've got in information technology , Moore 's good performance technology , Moore 's Law , Moore 's price performance from about 12 to 24 months .
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer fell .
Now look at this curve .
It 's Moore 's Law for the last hundred years .
I want you to watch two things on this curve .
First , the soft thing that is -- in good , bad times , in war and peace , in war and peace , in the recession and peace , in the recession .
It 's the speed coming out of fast computers used to build faster computers .
It does n't stop before any major challenges .
And even though it 's in a law on the left , it 's going up on top .
The growth rate of technology is increasingly fast .
And on this curve , <unk> of Moore 's Law , there 's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today .
The computation in the cloud , which my friends from Autodesk call infinite , sensors and networks and networks , and the ability to democratize personalized , and their ability to democratize production and the ability to democratize production , digital biology , the nanomaterials and the AI .
I mean , how many saw the victory at `` Watson from Watson , from Watson , from IBM ?
It was epic .
I googled newspapers the best headline had .
And I loved this one : `` Watson <unk> humans . ''
Jeopardy is not an easy game .
He plays with the nuances of the human language nuances .
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud , it 's available for everybody in the mobile phone .
Four years ago here at TED , Ray Kurzweil and I , we launched a new university called <unk> University .
We teach these technologies to our students , and in particular , how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
And every year we asked them to release a company or a product or a service that I can positively affect the lives of a billion people , a decade .
Think about that , the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people today .
Thirty years ago , 30 years ago .
Today , we can point out a <unk> companies that have already done .
When I think about creating abundance , it does n't mean to create a fancy life of the planet 's planet ; it 's about creating a life of what possible .
It 's about taking that , which is scarce .
You see , scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources .
I 'll give you an example .
It 's a story of Napoleon Three 's history coined .
He 's the guy on the left guy .
I invited dinner for dinner .
Napoleon 's troops ate it ate by silver covered , and the same Napoleon , with covered with gold .
But the king of <unk> , ate with aluminum covered .
You see , aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet -- worth more than gold and platinum .
For that reason , the tip of the 9/11 to Washington is aluminum .
You see , even though aluminum is the size of the mass percent of Earth , does not come like pure metal .
It 's tied up by oxygen and <unk> .
But then it got the <unk> and made the aluminum something cheap that we use it as if it were <unk> .
It would take this analogy towards future .
Let 's think about the energy shortage .
Ladies and gentlemen and gentlemen , we 're on a planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
They get the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes .
It 's not about scarcity , but about accessibility .
And there 's good news .
This year , for the first time , the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the element of diesel : 10 rupees , versus 17 rupees .
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year .
Last month , MIT , MIT , which shows that a study that shows that the last decade of the decade , the solar power , the solar electricity will cost six cents an <unk> per hour compared to about 15 cents to national average .
And if we have plenty of energy , we also have plenty of water .
Let 's talk about the wars in the water .
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed the spacecraft out on Earth in 1990 to the Earth , in 1990 , after the Saturn happened ?
I 'm a famous picture . How was it called ?
`` A pale blue dot . ''
Because we live on a planet of water .
We live on a planet , covered in 70 percent of water .
Yes , <unk> percent is saltwater , two percent ice is ice , and we fight for 0.5 percent of the planet 's water , but also there 's an hope here .
It 's an available technology not in 10 years , but right now .
nanotechnology , the nanomaterials .
In a conversation with Dean Kamen 's conversation this morning , one of the innovators in <unk> -- I 'd like to share with you , I gave up permission to do it -- your technology is called <unk> <unk> anymore .
It 's able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water a day from any saltwater <unk> , polluted water , <unk> water , <unk> <unk> .
The Coca-Cola president ends up with a major test test of hundreds of these units in the developing world .
If that comes right , and I have full confidence in that way , Coca-Cola is going to be , Coca-Cola in <unk> countries on the planet .
This is an <unk> innovation that today there is .
And we 've seen it in mobile phones .
My God , we 're going to get to the 70 percent penetration in the world in the developing world in the end of 2013 for the end of 2013 , and in the end of 2013 , we 're going to get to the 1970s .
Think about it , that <unk> warrior has better mobile communications communications , that the President of the Reagan were , 25 years ago .
And , of course , with a smartphone with Google , has access to more knowledge and information that the President Clinton was about 15 years ago .
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted that .
Better than that , the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> , <unk> video and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> , <unk> video , images , libraries of <unk> diagnostic , <unk> now , and lose market value with mobile phones .
Maybe it 's the best thing to get in healthcare .
Last month , I had the delight to announce with the <unk> Foundation <unk> <unk> , 10 million dollars .
We 're challenging the teams of the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device that they talk about , and because they have an A.I . , they can be extracted , they can be extracted from the finger and finger 's blood .
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certified medical team .
Imagine this device in the middle of developing world , where there are no doctors , where the burden of morbidity is about 25 percent , and there 's 1.3 percent of health care .
When this device sends up a RNA or DNA that does n't recognize it , call the health and first , first , stop the pandemic .
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance .
I call it the one billion .
The white lines here are the population .
We just went through the brand seven billion .
By the way , the better protection of demographic explosion is to give us the world of education and health is to give us the world .
In 2010 , we had less than two billion people in 2010 , connected .
By 2020 , going from two billion to five billion users of the Internet users .
Three billion minds never before heard of the global conversation comes up to the global conversation .
What will these people want ?
What damage ? What should you have ?
And instead of an economic collapse will have the biggest economic injection of history .
These people represent tens of billions of dollars <unk> in the global economy .
And more health care about <unk> , from a better education with the Khan Academy , and because of 3D prints in the cloud , it will be more productive than ever before .
What can we have to provide three three more from members of humanity , healthy healthy healthy healthy healthy healthy healthy healthy healthy people ?
How about voices never before you heard ?
What if we give them the oppressed , wherever they are , a voice to be heard and being able to act for the first time ?
What are these three three billion ?
And if they are contributions we ca n't predict ?
And one thing I 've learned with the X Prize is that small teams , guided by their passion with a clear goal , can do things , extraordinary things , things that were before they could only do the big corporations and the governments .
I 'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me .
There 's a program that maybe you know .
It 's called <unk> .
You know it at the University of Washington in Washington in Washington .
It 's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein .
The folds determine structure and functionality .
It 's very important about medical research .
And so far , it was a <unk> problem .
They 've played with this with college professors , among others .
Then hundreds of thousands of people came up and started playing them .
And it 's shown that the machinery of human patterns recognition machinery of human patterns , it 's better <unk> proteins than the best computers .
Ladies and gentlemen , what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet 's big challenges .
We have the tools with this exponential technology .
We have the passion of <unk> of <unk> .
We have the capital of <unk> .
And we have three billion minds of new minds that are going to be working on the solution of great challenges and doing what we should do .
We have ahead in some extraordinary decades .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about a very small idea .
The <unk> is starting .
And as the idea can be explained in a minute , I 'll give you three examples of time .
The first story is Charles Darwin , one of my heroes .
He was here , as you know in 1835 .
Maybe they thought he ran away , but it did n't .
They actually pick up fish .
And he described one of them as `` common . ''
It was grouper .
He was very caught it until the 1880s of 1880 .
Now the fish is the Red List <unk> .
But we 've heard this story many times about Galapagos and other places , so that has nothing special about it .
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos .
We still think they 're <unk> .
<unk> are still saying that they 're still intact .
So what happens here ?
The second story is also illustrates another concept : <unk> shift .
Because I was there in 1971 , in 1971 , studying a lagoon in West Africa .
I was there because I grew up in Europe , and then I wanted to work in Africa .
I thought it could be <unk> .
I burned a lot with the sun , and I was convinced that I was n't there .
This is my first exposure .
The lagoon was surrounded by palm , and as you can see , from some mangroves .
There was about 20 centimeters , a black beard <unk> .
And the fishery of this tilapia was very abundant and spent for a good moment , so he was made out of Ghana .
When I went there 27 years later , the amount of fish had dropped in half .
Let 's take the five centimeters up .
It 's an <unk> genetic pressure .
There were fish .
In a way , they were still happy .
And the fish were still happy to be there .
I mean , nothing changed , but everything has changed .
My third story is , I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia .
In the 1970s -- -- well , in the 1970s , -- well , in the 1970s , there was a lot of development projects .
Now fishing fishing was about the countries that had already had 100,000 fishermen , <unk> the industrial fishery .
And this boat , quite ugly , was called the <unk> 4 .
I went fishing in him , and we did studies in the southern Sea of China <unk> , and , especially , on the Java Sea .
What we captured there was something <unk> .
<unk> , now , the sea bottom .
Ninety percent of what we captured were sponges and other animals that are at the bottom .
And most of the fish are tiny spots on some remains , the remains , the remains fish coral fish .
In short , in short , the sea bottom went on the deck and then came out .
These images are extraordinary because the transition is so fast .
Within a year , you do a study and then fishing the commercial fishing .
The bottom is going to be a solid coral fund , in this case , to be a <unk> .
This is a dead turtle .
They ate them . He ate them because they were dead .
Once we captured a living .
I was n't really aware .
So , they wanted to kill her because it was a good food .
This mountain of remains what collect fishermen every time they go to an area where they 've never got fish .
But it 's not documented .
We turn the world , but we do n't remember it .
It would be the starting point , at the new level , not remembering what was there .
If you 're doing this , something like that .
On the Y-axis is good : biodiversity , number of killer whales , the <unk> of the country , the water supply .
And that changes over time . Change , because people do things with <unk> things .
Every generation to use the images , I received the beginning of your conscious life like the normal and you 're normal and you extrapolate forward .
The difference .
They do n't perceive the loss that happened before .
You can analyze the accumulation of changes .
And in the end to keep a little remains miserable .
And that , largely , is we want to do it now .
We want to maintain things that are no longer , or they 're not what they were .
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies do , they kill animals without knowing what they 've done to a few generations later .
Because obviously an animal that 's very abundant , before they go extinct , it 's rare .
You do n't lose the abundant animals .
You lose animals little frequent .
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss .
Over time , we focus on large animals , and in a sea synonymous with great fish .
They become rare because we take them off .
Over time , there are just a few fish , but we think that is the starting point .
And the question is , why do we accept this ?
Well , because we do n't know it was different .
In fact , a lot of people , scientists , who were very different from .
And they 'll do it because the evidence presented in a way before it 's not the way they would expect it to have the evidence .
For example , the anecdote that some of some of the other people , like that was that we can see a lot of fish in this area ca n't be used , or usually use the scientists of fishing , because it 's not `` scientist . ''
So , we have a situation where people do n't know the past , but we lived in <unk> societies , because they do n't trust the sources of the past .
There 's a huge role that you can deliver a protected marine protected area .
Because with marine protected areas , we really recreated the past .
They 're going to look at the past that people ca n't conceive , because the starting point has been run , very low .
That 's for the people that you can see a protected protected area and they can benefit from the vision that it provides , which allows them to start out .
And what about people who ca n't do that because they do n't have access , like people in the Midwest , for example ?
I think there 's the arts and movies , maybe you can fill the simulation , and the simulation .
This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay .
There were a long time ago gray whales in Chesapeake Bay long ago , 500 years ago .
And you may have noticed that the nuances and <unk> are like `` Avatar . ''
And if you think about `` Avatar , '' if you think why people are in the film -- I mean -- why is the film story , and they 're talking about the history of the images ?
Because it raises something , it 's been lost .
So my recommendation , the only one to give , is to Cameron , `` Avatar under water . ''
Thank you very much .
Hi . I 'm Kevin <unk> , the YouTube trends of YouTube -- and I look at YouTube YouTube videos .
It 's true .
So today , we 'll see why videos are doing viral and importance of videos .
We all want to be stars : celebrities , singers , comedians , comedians -- when I was younger , that seemed very , very difficult thing .
But today , the web makes any of us , or of our actions , copper in a part of our global culture .
Anybody can be famous in the Internet in a <unk> .
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube a minute .
And from those , just a little viral viral does , and it gets countless views of and wins .
How does that happen ?
Three things : creators , of trends , participation communities , surprise communities .
Okay , let 's start .
<unk> <unk> : Oh , my God , my God , my God .
Oh my God !
Wow .
<unk> , <unk> !
KA : Last year , <unk> launched this video out of his house in Yosemite National Park .
In 2010 , it was 23 million times .
This chart shows the collections of popularity of the past summer 's popularity .
He was n't talking a viral video .
I just wanted to share a double rainbow .
That 's what you do if Yosemite Mountain <unk> Mountain <unk> .
There was already a lot of videos from nature .
This video was published in January .
So what happened here ?
It was Jimmy <unk> .
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet to popularity .
<unk> as <unk> as <unk> <unk> are present , new and interesting and <unk> to a wider audience .
Rebecca Black : This is Friday , Friday . You have to start on Friday . You all want it to go on on a week last week , the weekend . <unk> , on Friday . <unk> , on Friday . So you 're going on on Friday .
`` <unk> '' of Black Black is one of the most popular videos of the year .
They saw it almost 200 million times this year .
This graph shows the frequency frequency you use .
Just like <unk> rainbow , this video seemed to have emerged from nowhere .
So what happened this day ?
Well , it was Friday , right .
And if you ask those other peaks , they 're also Friday .
But what happened this day , this day , on Friday ?
Well , he took her <unk> and many blogs started to write about it .
Michael J. Nelson Nelson , of <unk> Science , was one of the first people to make a joke joke about on Twitter .
But what 's important is that a person or a group of <unk> , we have a view , and they share it with a broader public , accelerating the process of view .
So , this community of people who share this big inner joke then starts to talk about and do things .
And now there 's 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube .
Just in the first seven days , in the first seven days , a parody of each of the other days .
Unlike the one-way century , in the 20th century , this community is our community participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon or doing something new with that .
`` <unk> Cat '' is a loop loop with a chord music .
That 's this way .
This year was about 50 million times .
And if you think that 's weird , you know that there 's a <unk> version that has seen four million times .
So even the cats saw this video .
And there are cats that watched other cats see the video .
But what 's important here is the creativity that sparked the Internet that sparked the Internet .
There was <unk> .
Somebody made a version of the old .
And then it was international .
Suddenly , a whole community of enlightenment made that this would happen to be a silly joke at something that we can all all form .
Because today we just enjoy , we do .
Who could have predicted that ?
Who could have predicted that , who might have predicted twice `` double <unk> or Rebecca Black or `` <unk> Cat '' ?
What a script might have been written to you ?
In a world that goes up two days of video per minute , just that really unexpected and unexpected can be <unk> in the way that these things have done it .
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind of <unk> against tickets in New York in New York , I admit I did n't get interested in it .
Casey <unk> : I 've got to not circular <unk> for the <unk> , but there are often obstacles that they ca n't be absorbed properly from the <unk> .
KA : Thanks to the surprise and his humor Casey <unk> to the five million to see and understand his idea .
So this approach is worth the whole new approach that we make ways .
And all of this leads to a big question .
<unk> <unk> : What does this mean ?
<unk> .
KA : What does this mean ?
<unk> , creative communities , creative communities , absolutely unexpected , are features of a new kind of means of a new culture , that we all have access to , and the audience that defines popularity .
As I said before , one of the world 's celebrity celebrity , Justin Bieber , Justin Bieber .
Do wo n't be permission to express your ideas .
Now we 're all a little masters of our pop culture .
These are not the characteristics of the old media , barely from the current media , but they are <unk> entertainment .
Thank you .
This is not an finished story .
It 's a puzzle that 's still going to put together .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Imagine the first piece : a man burning the work of a lifetime .
It 's a poet , a playwright , a man whose entire life had been supported in the only single unit of unity and the <unk> of his country .
Imagine , while the communists comes in <unk> , facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain .
The words , for so long , friends now .
They become quiet .
He died in broken through history .
He 's my grandfather .
I never met .
But our lives are much more than our memories .
My grandmother allowed me to forget his story .
My task was to let it out in vain , and my lesson was to learn that history , and I was to learn that the story about <unk> , but <unk> . ''
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to the dawn in the sea .
My mother , <unk> , was just 18 years old when her father died , and a marriage <unk> and two little girls .
For her life , life had been devoted to a task alone : the escape exhaust in Australia .
It was inconceivable for her that I could n't make it .
And after a hundred <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat slid into the sea dressed being fishing as fishing .
All the adults knew .
The biggest fear was pirate pirates , rape and death .
Like most adults , my mother was carrying a little bit with poison with poison .
If we could , first we took , my sister and my grandmother , and then my grandmother would have my grandmother .
My earliest memories are from that boat , the constant pace of the engine , and the bow into each wave , and the vast global horizon , and the vast horizon .
I do n't remember the pirate pirates , but they were <unk> with the bravery of men in our boat , or the motor dying of men in our boat , or the engine dying to be able to cut for six hours .
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the Malaysia coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , finish the journey was too much for him , and the first apple was too long for him ; and the first apple I tried , given by the men of the platform .
No apple has had the same taste .
After three months , in a refugee camp , <unk> in Melbourne .
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together .
We set up in <unk> , a suburb of kind of workers , whose population is made of migrants .
Unlike the middle class of middle-class , whose existence I did n't know , in <unk> , there was no sense of right .
The smells that were coming from the shops were the rest of the world .
And the snippets of <unk> <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common .
My mother worked in farms , then in a car assembly line , working six days , twice as much .
Yet , I found time in order to study English and get an IT degree .
We were poor .
Every dollars was mapped , and that sets that an extra bonus in English and mathematics , would not matter what you should take away , which was generally new clothes ; it was always <unk> .
Two pairs in school for school , one to hide the holes in the other people .
A school uniform had a school uniform because I had to last six years .
And I was rare and <unk> about the eyes of <unk> eyes and some graffiti : `` Bless you , come home . ''
At home , where ?
Something in me would be <unk> .
I was accumulating determination and a voice saying , `` I 'm going to <unk> . ''
My mother , my sister and I <unk> on the same bed .
My mother was taxed every night , but we told ourselves about our day and listen to the movements of our grandmother at home .
My mother suffer nightmares , all of the boat .
And my task was to be wake up until his nightmares were going to be able to do <unk> power .
She opened a computer store , then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business .
And women came out with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and angry , and kids are trapped in between two worlds from two worlds .
They looked for subsidies and sponsors .
And they created centers .
I lived in parallel worlds .
In one , it was the classic Asian student , relentless with what I 'm going to think of myself .
On the other hand , I was very highly skilled in poor lives , tragically <unk> by drug abuse , drug abuse and isolation .
But many got help over the years .
And for that job , when I was studying my last year of law , I was elected , the <unk> woman in the year .
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other , but their edges did n't fit .
As I read , an anonymously to <unk> , it was now as I read , refugee and social activist , invited to talk about sites that I 've never heard , and in houses whose existence she would never have imagined .
I did n't know the protocols .
I did n't know how to use the covered .
I did n't know how to talk about wine .
I did n't know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to retreat in the routines and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother and two mother ending the day as they did for almost 20 years as they did for almost 20 years , <unk> over the day , <unk> on the same bed , still .
And I told my mom that I could n't do that .
It reminded me that I was the same age that she had when we got onto the boat .
The `` not '' had ever been a choice .
`` Make it , '' he said , `` and you 're not what you 're not . ''
So he talked about <unk> youth and education , and they 're <unk> and they 're exposed .
And the more frankly , the more I was talking about it was to talk about .
I met people from all the paths of life , a lot of them doing what they loved , living on the border of it as possible .
And although I finished my bachelor 's degree , I realized I could n't stay in a lawyer .
There had to be another piece of the puzzle .
And I realized at the same time that it 's okay to be an unknown , a little back , new at the scene -- and not just good at it , but it 's something that is what I 'm grateful for , perhaps a single ship of the ship .
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> , the horizons , it can easily mean accepting the horizons of your province .
I gave the enough steps outside my happy place to know that , yes , the world breaks , but not the way we fear it .
<unk> that would n't have been <unk> tremendously .
There was energy there , a relentless optimism , a rare mix of humility and courage .
So I kept my intuition .
I 'd come up with a small group of people who say , `` You can not be done , '' it was a compelling challenge .
For one year , we did n't have a dime .
At the end of every day , making a giant pot that we all shared .
<unk> them up to the <unk> night .
Most of our ideas were crazy , but some brilliant , and we opened up .
I made the decision to move to the U.S .
after one journey .
My hunches again .
Three months later , I had moved , and the adventure continued .
Before I end , let me tell you about my grandmother .
She grew up in a time when <unk> was the social norm , and the local <unk> was the person who mattered .
Life has n't changed for centuries .
Her father died shortly after she was born .
The mother was raised alone .
The 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother beat her beat .
Without her husband 's supported by her husband , and he was carrying the cause for her , and he was much more <unk> caused when he won .
And it ca n't proved it wrong .
I was in the shower in a hotel room in Sydney when she died , 1,000 miles in Melbourne in Melbourne .
I looked through the <unk> of the shower , and I saw him stop the other side .
I knew I had come to say .
My mother called minutes later .
Days later , we went past a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around their coffin .
We tell stories and make sure that we were still with it .
At night , a monk came and told us that I had to close the coffin .
My mother asked us to raise his hand .
I asked the monk , `` Why is your hand warm , and the rest of the body so cold ? ''
`` Because you 've taken your hand in the morning , '' he said .
`` They have n't <unk> . ''
If there 's a nerve in our family , that runs through women .
Since we were , and how life we were and how life formed , now we can see that the men that have come up with our lives would have been frustrated .
The defeat would easily <unk> .
Now I want to have my own own kids , and I 'm wondering about the boat .
Who might want that wish to do that ?
However , I 'm afraid , I 'm afraid of the privilege of the right .
Can I give you a bow in your lives , turning it into every wave , the <unk> pace of the engine , the <unk> pace of the engine , the vast horizon that does n't guarantee anything ?
I do n't know .
But if I could give it and see them safe , it would do it .
<unk> <unk> , and also the mother 's mom is today , in the fourth or fifth row is a fifth line .
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago .
I was in the desert sky under the sky drops , Sufi singer <unk> Ali .
We were having a conversation of how nothing has changed since the time of the old Indian epic .
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car , and they wanted the sky .
Now we do with airplanes .
At that time , the great prince Indian warrior , I had to get thirst with an arch and <unk> on the ground , they got a bow , he collected the water and <unk> .
Now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines .
The conclusion that we took out was that the machinery had replaced the machinery by it .
And that was really exciting to me .
Every time I felt a little bit more time .
I would tell you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I did n't have the camera , if I did n't have the camera friends .
It seemed like the technology I had to allow magic , not to kill her .
As a girl , my grandfather gave me a <unk> pocket silver .
And this piece of 50 of 50 years was to my most magical thing .
It became a golden door to a world full of images , pirate pirate <unk> .
I had the feeling that cell phones , the luxury clocks and ca n't have the cameras prevent us .
We hold our inspiration .
That 's why I launched , I threw in this technological world to see how to use it to create magic , instead of killing her .
<unk> books since 16 .
So when I saw the iPad , I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the whole world .
You can know how we take the book .
where are we .
They put the text with the image , animation , sound and touch it .
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk> .
But what does that work for us ?
I 'm about to launch <unk> , an interactive application for iPad .
It says , `` puts your fingers on every light . ''
And so -- it says , `` This box belongs to ... '' I write my name .
And so I get back to me , and I 'm going .
In several moments , I got a <unk> -- the iPad knows where , thanks to GPS -- that 's led to me .
My inner little girl inside of all of these possibilities .
I 've talked a lot about magic .
And I do n't mean magicians and dragons , but the magic of childhood , to the ideas that <unk> of children .
For some reason , fireflies in a jar always get me .
So here , we need to shift the iPad to release fireflies .
And actually you light up your way into what you smell in the book .
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a little bit like a little bit .
So here , every book and every single world becomes a little <unk> that I drag into this magical device , inside the device .
And this opens up a map .
Now , in every fantasy book , there have always been maps , but they 've been static , and they 've been static maps .
This is a map that grows and guide you through the rest of the book .
In certain points of the book , it also reveals .
Now I 'm going to go in .
Another incredibly important aspect for me is to create Indian content and contemporary things .
These people here are <unk> .
We 've all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people were out of India know their Indian counterparts do know their Indian counterparts , how many people do know their Indian counterparts ?
These poor <unk> have been trapped on Indra in Indra cameras for millennia , in an old and wet book .
And so we 're bringing them back into contemporary child history .
Now , in a story that tries to present issues as well as the environmental crisis .
And , talking about the environmental crisis , one of the problems of the last 10 years has been locked up together , attached to their computers , have not left the outside world .
But now with mobile technology , we can take our kids out of the natural world with their technology .
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure that you have to go out on the outside , taking the camera or iPad , and we collect different natural objects from different natural objects .
As a girl , I had lots of collections , and stones , rocks , rocks and shells .
For some reason , kids do n't .
So to reclaim this past childhood , you have to go out and , in one chapter of childhood , it 's a picture of one of chapter , then , then it 's going to be <unk> .
In another chapter , you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex , and then label them down .
So , it creates a digital collection of pictures of photos that then can be put on the Web .
A boy in London puts a picture of a fox , and says , `` Oh , today I saw a fox . ''
A child in India says , `` Today I saw a monkey . ''
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking .
And within the variations of connection between magic , the Earth and technology are many possibilities .
In the next book , we said to have an interaction on the iPad , and the video on , and by augmented reality , sees a group of cartoons that appear on the inside plants .
At a moment , the screen is filled with leaves .
And you have to make the sound and <unk> sound so you can read the rest of the book .
Let 's go into a world where nature 's forces are <unk> with technology and magic , and we 're going to get some of the technology back to another .
It 's the power of sun .
We 're moving to our children and ourselves the natural world , happy magic and child love that we sit down through a simple story .
Thank you .
I 'd like to tell you about why many <unk> projects fail .
And I think , really , the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients .
And one of the things we did at <unk> University was actually <unk> to a director of listening .
And not in a very scientific way , she raised a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients , `` What 's going on ? '' family and known , `` What happens ? ''
`` How can we help it ?
And we tend to think , that this is one of the biggest problems that everyone , or maybe not everybody , but most of the <unk> projects fail , because we stop listening .
This is my Wi-Fi scale . It 's very simple .
He has a doorknob on and off .
Every morning I get .
And yes , I have a challenge as you can see .
I set up the challenge of 95 kilograms .
But it 's so simple , that every time I connect to your <unk> Health .
And my <unk> doctor has access to him too . So , he can see what my weight problem is , not at the same time that it 's the same time he needs to be it , not at the same time he needs to be able to go back and sort of see it back .
But there 's another thing .
As some of you know , I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter .
So every morning , I 'm connected to my Wi-Fi scale , and before you go up my car , people start to talk about me : <unk> , today , today , I think you need a light lunch lunch .
That 's the best thing that you can go through , because it 's the peer pressure used to help patients , because it could be used to obesity , and so that it could be used for patients to stop smoking .
On the other hand , it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some recreational activity to have more control control of their health .
So from the week , next week .
This little bit connected to an iPhone iPhone or another device .
And people will be able to , from their homes , take their blood pressure , helping their doctor , and share it with others , for example , 100 dollars .
This is the point where patients assume a position , they come back back over control of control and being captains of their own ship , but also it can help us care from their own boat , because of the challenges that we face , like the firing costs of attention , the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> costs and other issues .
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients engage in the team .
And you can do it with techniques like this , but also through crowdsourcing .
And one of the things we did want to share with you with you .
We all have shipping controls .
Maybe even we have our cell phones .
We know perfectly , where ATM ATMs are in <unk> .
Also where you 're all <unk> .
And of course , we can find out chains of fast food .
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient ?
We asked , but nobody knew .
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this moment .
What we did was doing crowdsourcing in the Netherlands .
We created a website , and we asked the audience , if you see a <unk> , please get <unk> , <unk> where , and when it 's open , and when it 's open , sometimes open up in office schedules and others are closed .
And over 10,000 <unk> are already presented in the Netherlands .
The next step was to look for the application for that .
And we made an app for the iPad .
We created an application for <unk> , augmented reality to find these <unk> .
And every time you 're in the city of <unk> and someone 's collapses , they can use their iPhone , and next weeks to use their cell phone cell phone , to find the nearest <unk> , which can be saving lives .
And from today , I 'd like to introduce this , not just like <unk> <unk> , which is the name of the product , but also as <unk> .
And we want to do it globally .
We 're <unk> all the colleagues in the world , in other universities , to help us find , work and work and act like a center for the crowdsourcing <unk> worldwide .
Every time you 're on vacation and somebody <unk> , it can be a relative or somebody in front of you , you can find it out .
And I also would like to invite companies in the whole world that they could try to validate them together .
They could be <unk> services or telephony people , for example , to see if the <unk> it 's shown is still in place .
Please help us , not only improve health , but taking control of it .
Thank you very much .
I 'm here to share 'my tonight . ''
Or is it a picture ?
Because of course , it 's photographs that you ca n't take with your cameras .
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years .
I mixed with my passion before the drawing , but it was a little different because of the camera , the process was in planning .
And when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you press the trigger .
So , for me , photography , I had more to be able to do with being in the right place , at the right time .
It seemed like anybody could do it .
So I wanted to create something different , a process that I started to press the browser .
Here 's like this : a building on a very <unk> road .
But it has an unexpected twist .
And , despite it , it holds a level of realism .
Or pictures like this , dark and colorful , colorful , but with the common goal of keeping the level of consciousness .
And when I say realism .
Because of course , it 's not something that you can do , but I always want that look like it seems to have been captured in some way as a photograph .
Here 's what you will have to think about a moment to figure out the trick .
It has more to capture an idea from capturing a moment .
But what 's the trick that makes it seem real ?
Are you the details , or the colors ?
Did you see the light ?
What creates illusion ?
Sometimes the illusion is perspective .
But at the end it 's all about our way to interpret the world , and how you can perceive it in a two-dimensional surface .
It 's actually not about a realist , but what we think is realistic .
So I think the foundations are very simple .
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and together to create an alternative reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three <unk> objects imaginable , something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world .
But combined in ways you can create something that still looks three-dimensional , as if it existed .
But at the same time , we know it does n't exist .
So , we pretend to the brain because the brain does n't accept the fact that it really does n't make sense .
And I see the same process by combining the photographs .
It 's really in combining different realities .
And the things that you make a picture look like , you think it 's where you do n't even think , the things we do n't even think , the things around us that are around us in our daily lives .
But by combining pictures , it 's very important to think about it , because otherwise it 's going wrong .
So I 'd like to say that there are three simple simple rules to go to achieve realistic results .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But combined , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same same perspective .
Second , photos must have the same kind of light .
And these two images they have these requirements , they were taken at the same height and the same kind of light .
The third point is to do impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of different images with a perfect union .
It has to be impossible to see where the image was made .
This is another example .
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is manipulated .
But this image is totally composed by pictures of different places .
And personally , I think it 's easier to create a place that will find it , because you do n't need to put any danger in the ideas that you have on your head .
But it takes a lot of planning .
And as I thought about this idea in winter , I knew it was several months for <unk> , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle .
For example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
The shores of a different location .
The <unk> part was captured in a rock well .
And yes , I even made red the house at the top of the island looks more like lower .
So in order to get a realistic result , I think it 's missing planning .
It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
Then we have to combine the different pictures .
And here every piece is very good meant .
If you do a good job when you take the photos of the outcome can be very beautiful and at once very realistic .
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination .
Thank you .
Let me start showing you a slide slide on technology , very boring .
Please , if you can put it on it ...
It 's a diagram anyone from a folder .
I 'm not interested in showing you the details , but the general aspect .
This is an analysis we 've been doing about the power of deep-sea microprocessors versus the power of local area .
What 's interesting about this is that this , as a kind of a straight line that we tend to see , it 's kind of a straight line on logarithmic .
In other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale .
I 'm going to talk about <unk> technology , which is a new novel technology .
Here 's something strange .
And that 's what I 'm going to talk about .
Please light the lights .
<unk> more intensity , because writing about paper .
Why did we plot technological curves at <unk> scales ?
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve where , let 's say , these are the years , or some unit of time , and this would be any unit of time , and this would be any kind of unit of time , and that would be any bit of the technology that I want to draw the diagram .
It would be like this .
It does n't say much .
But if you plot it , for example , some other technology , like transportation , on a <unk> curve that would be very dumb , see a straight line .
But if something like this , you can give a qualitative change .
If the technology of transportation transportation as fast as the microprocessors , we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds .
But it does n't go to that pace .
There is no precedent in the history of technological development of a <unk> growth that every few years to make progress of magnitude .
The question I want to ask is -- look at these exponential curves , we see that they do n't follow forever .
It 's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes .
Let 's give you one of two things .
Or it 's going to turn into a typical curve itself like this until something completely different , or maybe I 'll do something like that .
That 's all it can happen .
I 'm optimistic , so I think maybe that 's going to happen something like that .
And so , we 're now in the midst of a transition .
In this line , we 're in a transition from what used to be the world alone , a new way .
So what I 'm trying to ask , ask , is , what is that a new way to take the world ?
Where new state is going to get the world ?
The transition seems very , very confused if we 're engaged in it .
I remember a child the future was happening in 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
This is a conference where people talk about the future , and we see the future is still the way 2000 .
That 's all we see .
In other words , the future has shrunk , year after year , throughout my lifetime .
But I think that 's because we feel something is happening .
We can feel it up .
And we know that it does n't have a lot of sense of about 30 or 50 years , because everything is going to be different than what we 're doing today does n't make any sense .
So I want to talk to you about how it might be , how it might be that transition that we experience .
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that do n't have a lot of technology and computer technology .
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at things in the long term .
The time scale that I 'd like to do , is the time of life on Earth .
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years .
So , we go back up a half two billion years , when the Earth was a big sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that would go around it .
So if we look at the way that chemicals , we give us an idea of how things happened .
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of the RNA , and I 'm going to tell you a simple version of this , and it 's that , at that point , and at that time , there was a little bit of oil with all kinds of chemical prescriptions inside .
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them into bringing materials from outside the outside , and these drops grew a particular combination of these oil droplet .
And they started division .
In a sense , those were the most primitive mobile shapes , these are more primitive cell forms .
But those blobs were n't alive , in the current sense , because each one of them contained a random random recipe of chemicals .
And every time you have a divided distribution of the chemicals that held up with the chemicals that held it .
So every droplet was a little different .
In fact , the drops that somehow will be better at the time to incorporate the chemicals around the surrounding chemicals , they were growing up more , more chemicals , and have more divided .
Usually they were more represented , they were more represented .
It was a form of life , chemistry , very simple , but things get interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction .
And in some ways we do n't really understand that are learned to store information .
They learned to save information , which was the recipe from the cell , a special chemist called DNA .
In other words , they 're <unk> in this meaningless pointless system , a writing system that allowed them to register .
What 's amazing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved half a billion years .
Our recipe , our genes , have exactly the same code , that same writing system .
In fact , every living living is just expressed with the exact same array of letters and the same code .
And one of the things that I just did for fun -- we can write things with this code .
So here 's 100 <unk> of white dust that try to hide the safety of the airport safety .
But it contains -- I took this code -- the code that 's simple letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote personal data in this piece of DNA , and we 'll call it 10 at the 22 times .
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card and I have a lot for everyone in the world , and it 's in fact , for every person in the world is here .
If it was a virus , he would have put it up in the entire room .
What was the next step ?
Writing the DNA was an interesting step .
This made cells just happy another one billion years .
But then , another big step happened in the things that are very different very different , and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information , forming information communities , cells .
I do n't know if you know it , but bacteria can swap DNA .
So , for example , he evolved antibiotic resistance .
Some bacteria found the way that they found the way to avoid penicillin , it 's <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria , and now there are lots of resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .
This communication gave up to the communities that they 're in a way , they were put together in it , and there was some synergy .
So they survive or failed to survive or whether a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community would say more , and they were going to be addressed by evolution .
And the tipping point happened when these communities went together so much , in fact , they came together and decided to write the entire recipe of the community together in a DNA chain .
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years .
And at that stage , we have multicellular communities , many kinds of different types of cells working together as a single organism .
In fact , we are a multicellular community .
We have a lot of cells that do n't act alone .
The skin cell serves without heart of your heart , or your muscles , or your brain , etc .
So , these communities evolved , and these communities evolved , something we call an organism .
The next level happened in these communities .
They started to <unk> information .
And to build very special structures that they did n't do more than processing information in community .
It 's the neural structures .
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cellular communities that those cell communities are .
In fact , they started specialize in the community being the <unk> structures of record , understanding and transmit information .
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
Because at that moment as individuals -- learning was confined to the duration of an organism , and not the time period of an evolutionary time as well .
So , an organism could , for example , learn not to eat a certain piece because he knew , and he got sick the last time and he ate .
That could happen in the life of an organism , because they had been built in these information processing structures that would have been learned for hundreds of thousands of years for the death processing that they would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years for death .
So the fact that the nervous system actually built those <unk> structures of accelerated information .
Because evolution could now happen to an individual individual .
It could happen in the time to learn .
But then of course , the individuals were discovered the trick of communication .
So , for example , the most refined version that we know is human language .
If we think , it 's an amazing invention .
I have a very complicated idea of vague idea .
I 'm here sitting on dumping and hopefully building a similar idea , vague , vague and confused , in their head that sort of vague analogy with mine .
But we took something very complicated to make it into sound , in sound sequences , and we make something very complicated in another brain .
That now allows us to start working as an organism .
In fact , like humanity , we 've started to make abstractions .
We now went through periods of multicellular organisms -- we 're going to make our methods of record methods , presentation and information processing .
For example , the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
telephony , computing , the video , the video tape , the video and so on , it 's the specialized mechanisms that we now build that information .
And that brings us into something much bigger , faster and able to evolve more than we did before .
Now evolution can happen at microseconds .
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which there is certain evolution with <unk> program in our eyes .
And now we have accelerated scales again .
The first stages of the story that I had taken one billion years from each .
The next stage , the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
Next , the next language , etc. , took less than a million years .
And the next one , like electronics , seems to take only a few decades .
The process is back back down ; I guess you 're the right word to call it something that accelerates their own pace of change .
The more it changes , the faster it does .
And I think that 's what we look at in this curve of the curve .
We see the process we see .
But I earn the life designing computers and computers , and I know that the mechanisms that we work out it would not be possible without the recent computer advances .
But now design objects of such something that would be impossible to design that it would be impossible to design .
I do n't know that every transistor in that machine .
There are billions .
Instead , with designers of <unk> <unk> , we think a level of abstraction , put it in the machine and the machine that does something that was something that you could not be able to get far further and get faster and faster than ever before .
In fact , sometimes sometimes a methods that we do n't even even understand .
A particularly interesting method that I 've been using lately , it 's evolution itself .
And we put it inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale .
And for example , in the most extreme cases , we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions .
We say , `` Please , please , you can run a hundred million sequences of random instructions ?
Could you run these random instructions randomly , execute , execute all of those programs , and take those more than what we want to do ? ''
In other words , I define what I want .
Let 's say I want to figure out numbers , to put a simple example .
So , we found the programs that come up and get the numbers together .
Of course , it 's unlikely that a random sequences of instructions , they 're <unk> numbers , so none of them did .
But one , luckily , could you find two numbers in the right order .
And I said , `` I mean , you could take the 10 percent of those random sequences that would get the task ?
We put those and <unk> the rest .
And now I 'm going to tell you the best by the numbers .
And let 's go back to <unk> following a process of analog reasoning to sex . ''
Let 's take two programs , you 're going to get children , who are <unk> , and that children will run the properties of both programs .
So we 've got a new generation of product combinations of programs that had a little bit more successful .
And we say , `` Please repeat the process . ''
Let 's go back again .
There were some mutations .
And it 's about again , and it 's about new generation , and it 's about again .
Well , each generation takes a few milliseconds .
So , I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few complicated cases , in complicated cases .
At the end , we end up with programs in shows that some numbers in absolutely perfect ways .
In fact , they are a much more efficient programs than I might have written by hand .
If I look at those programs I can not say how they work .
I 've tried to analyze it to see how they work .
These are dark , strangers .
But they do n't get it .
In fact , I know , I have the security that you get to get the goal , because they come from a <unk> bloodline with a <unk> bloodline that made it .
In fact , their lives depend on it .
I once was going on a 747 with Minsky 's weight , and he says , `` Look this .
He says , `` Open airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a safe flight . ' '' Does n't make you feel quiet ?
We know that engineering processes do n't work very well when they get complicated .
So we started to start dependent on computers to make a very different design processes process .
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex things that produce normal engineering .
However , we do n't understand the whole options .
In that sense , it goes in front in us .
We now use those programs to make computers much faster , and so that we can run these programs much faster .
I mean , it feeds back .
The thing goes and faster , and so I think it seems so confused .
Because all these technologies feed back .
We 're taking off .
And we 're at an analogous moment to the disease , when they became multicellular organisms .
We 're the amoebas and we can not understand what the hell on us are creating .
We 're at the tipping point .
But I think something comes from behind us .
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the final product of evolution .
And I think that all of us are part of creating whatever .
But now it comes lunch now , and I think stop here before I get rid of it .
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that you have to change .
And I think this starts with a doctor , and that 's me .
And I spend long enough time for me to give up a part of my fake prestige .
Before I treat my talk about my talk , let 's talk a little baseball .
Why not ?
We 're near the end , the World Series .
We love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of statistics .
There are hundreds of statistics .
It 's going to be `` <unk> rules '' -- you talk about statistics and form a big baseball team .
I 'm focusing on one of them and I hope that many of you , you know .
It 's called average <unk> .
And we talk about 300 , a <unk> <unk> 300 .
That means <unk> <unk> , three than 10 times .
That means the ball of the game the game of play without being stuck , and that anyone who tries to throw it out at the first base , do n't get to reach time , and then the second base will be saving to save .
Three 10 attempts .
You know what they call a <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
Well , really good , maybe the team of stars .
You know what they call a <unk> baseball of 400 ?
By the way , that 's someone who 's 10 taps down , it got four .
<unk> -- like legendary Ted Williams , the last player in the Major League of <unk> on a regular season in the League of <unk> in a regular season .
Now I think it 's going to my world of medicine where I 'm much more comfortable , or maybe less awkward , after what I 'm going to tell you today .
Suppose they have appendicitis , and they 're derivatives of a surgeon that 's also a record of 400 in <unk> .
It does n't work , right ?
Now suppose you live in a place away away , and a loved person has a beloved cardiologist , and your family 's drifting have , a cardiologist , a cardiologist , a cardiologist , a cardiologist . ''
But you know ?
She 's getting dramatically improved this year .
And the hits have been <unk> .
This is not working .
But I will ask you .
What do you think of you , who must be the average of a heart of a heart or orthopedic surgeon , a <unk> <unk> ?
1,000 , 1,000 .
And the truth of the matter is that no one in all of medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon or a doctor or a medical care issue .
What we do , though , is sending to the world , and I include , I include the mandate of being perfect .
That never , ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right .
And that was the message that I was doing when I was in medical school .
I was a spinning obsessive student <unk> .
Once , a fellow in high school , said , Brian Goldman a school for a blood test exam .
Like that .
I spent them on my little <unk> , in the nurses of the General Hospital in Toronto , not far from here .
And I learned all of the memory .
And from my kind of anatomy , I memorized the origin and the muscle , the <unk> of every artery that comes out of your aorta and frequent differential and not usual .
And I even knew as a differential diagnosis about how to put the kidney <unk> on the world .
And as much more knowledge and more knowledge .
And I was going very well ; <unk> me .
And <unk> of medical school with the impression that if you put everything , then it would know everything , and it would know everything , or as you can , all the way , do you know .
And it worked for a time , until I met the lady .
I was a resident at a university hospital in Toronto , in Toronto , when they brought in the lunch lady where I was brought to the emergency .
At that time , I was assigned by cardiology service at that time .
And when I applied a cardiologist to go on a cardiologist to attend to that patient .
and inform to the chief of residents .
When I saw the lady , I was very proud .
I heard a <unk> sound .
And when he <unk> , I heard a <unk> sound on both sides , which was struck me by heart failure .
In these conditions , the heart stops going to work , rather than pump the blood forward , the blood lungs -- these blood goes into the lungs , and that 's why you 're breathing hard to breathe .
And it was n't hard to diagnose .
I did that , and I started working on the treatment I would give .
I gave aspirin and medication to relieve the pressure in their heart .
I gave her <unk> , water pills , so that I could eliminate liquid .
And in an hour or two , she started feeling better .
And I felt very well .
And that was when I made the first mistake and sent it out to her .
I actually made two more mistakes .
She sent her home without talking to the chief of residents .
I do n't up the phone and did what it should have done , which I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for him to see her boss . ''
And if my boss would have seen it , would have been able to bring training data .
Maybe I did for a good reason .
Maybe I did n't want to be a resident to get out attention .
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibility , which could take care of my patients without even contact my chief .
The second mistake I made was worse .
When they send her home , I was n't paying attention to a voice inside my interior , saying , `` Goldman , is not a good idea . Do n't do you . ''
In fact , it was so insecure that I asked the nurse , I was taking care of my wife who was taking care of `` Do you think it goes to your house ? ''
And the nurse thought , and he said very <unk> , `` Yes , I think it 's okay . ''
I remember that like yesterday .
So that was that he signed the high , and the ambulance .
And I went back back to the hospital room .
The rest of that day , that afternoon , I had a feeling wrong in the stomach .
But I kept my job .
At the end of the day , I packed up to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home . And at that point , I did something that do n't normally do , normally , I do , usually .
I went through the emergency room on the way home .
And then another nurse , not who was taking from the lady 's lady who was taking off from the lady , but another , and he said , `` Three words , those three words that most of the emergency . ''
Other specialists are afraid too , but there 's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the patients <unk> .
The three words is : It remembers you ?
`` Does the patient remember home home ? ''
I asked the other <unk> in complete <unk> .
`` Well she came back , with the same tone of voice .
She was fine .
But I came back up and on the edge of death .
Within an hour of having come to his house after I gave her the high , suffered collapse and her family called 911 in an emergency room with 50 millimeters of <unk> , which means a shock hour .
I 'm just breathing blue , and I was blue .
emergency staff will come all their resources .
They gave her medication to climb blood pressure medication .
They put a ventilator .
I was a shock of it and <unk> to the spinal cord .
He had a mixture of feelings because of the <unk> was in intensive and waiting for all of the hope that he would recover .
And in the two days or three days , it was clear that we never get out .
He had irreversible damage .
The family came together .
And in eight or nine days , you would get what was happening .
And in ninth day , they let her go . The lady was going to go . Mrs. <unk> , and grandmother .
They say they never forget the names that they die from .
That was my first experience .
The next few weeks , I 'm going with that , and I experienced for the first time , the very first shame shame that exists in our medical culture , and I sat down alone , and I felt just isolated , without feeling with your colleagues .
You make peace and never make it that error .
It 's that shame that leaves a teaching .
The unhealthy embarrassment that I talk about is that that makes us feel very bad inside .
It 's the thing that we did not badly , but we 're bad .
And that felt .
And it was n't by my boss ; he was <unk> .
I talked to the family , and I 'm sure that you would get the stuff out and made sure that you do n't know .
And I kept getting those questions .
Why did n't my boss ask my boss ? Why did she send her home ?
And at my worst moments : Why did I make a mistake ?
Why did I choose about medicine ?
Little little feeling was <unk> .
And I started feeling better .
And on one day on a cloudy day , the sky opened up and finally came the sun , and wondered if I would feel better again .
And I did a deal with myself as with me where we were doing the efforts to be perfect perfect , not to make any more mistakes , and I would do that .
And so it was .
I went back to work .
But it came back .
Two of the years later , I was an assistant in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto , and I received a man from 25 years with pain in his throat .
I was very busy and in a hurry .
And he pointed out here .
I looked into her throat .
He got him penicillin in her home .
But while he went to the door to the door kept pointing out his throat .
Two days later , when I came to make my head change , my boss asked by talking to me about in his office .
And then three words : Does you remember the three words ?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in throat ?
Well he came back and did n't have a <unk> <unk> .
It had a potentially deadly condition called <unk> condition .
You can look for Google , it 's an infection , it 's not the throat , but from the top air goes out , and it can cause the closing of those pathways .
He , fortunately , not passed away .
They managed to get antibiotics by it goes <unk> and recovered .
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> , then I went back and went back and went back over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again again .
Two times in the same time on the emergency side , they do n't throw appendicitis anymore .
And it 's a great effort , especially working in a hospital , because we were going to get 14 patients at the same time .
But in both cases , I did n't send them home , and I do n't think I 've been a carelessness .
One of them thought I had a kidney calculus .
Order an X-ray of the kidneys , but it turned out normal , a colleague who was checking the patient was a certain sensibility , right , and called the surgeon .
The other patient was very with a lot of diarrhea .
I read the liquid order for me , and I asked my colleague that I can take it out .
I checked , and when certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant , he called the surgeon .
Both of them were operated operated and recovered .
But every case , I devoured .
But I 'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise , and as many colleagues say , it 's a mess .
The most significant have been over the last five years .
Just say , ashamed and not support .
And here 's the problem : if I ca n't get a <unk> and talk about my mistakes , if I ca n't find the <unk> that tell me what really happens , and I 'm going to be able to share this with my colleagues ?
How do I teach them that they do n't make the mistakes ?
If I would go back now to a place like this , I would have no idea what you think about .
When you last time you heard somebody talk about failure , after failure , after failure of failure ?
Of course , at a party you 'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors , but you do n't hear somebody talk about their own mistakes .
And if I knew and my colleagues as well , that a <unk> in my hospital in <unk> leg , believe me would have difficulty looking at looking at the eyes .
This is the system that we have .
<unk> denial about .
It 's the system where there are two positions : those who make mistakes and those who make mistakes and those who do n't , who are not going to sleep , and those who do , which are not going to sleep , and those who have some great results and outcomes .
And it 's almost like an ideological reaction , like antibodies that start to attack that person .
We have the idea that if we go back from medicine to the people who make mistakes , we get a secure system out there .
But that brings two problems .
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism , I 've done a <unk> personal study of medical health and medical errors , to learn from the first article that I wrote to Toronto , from the first article that I wrote to Toronto , to my program `` White <unk> , Black Art . ''
And what I learned is that the mistakes are ubiquitous .
We work in a system where the errors happen in every day , where one of every 10 drugs <unk> in the hospital is wrong is wrong , or <unk> is not right , in a system where the infections are increasingly , and more numerous , causing chaos and death .
In this country , they die in this country , 4,000 Canadian medical errors were preventable .
The U.S. Institute , established 100,000 .
In both cases , it 's about <unk> <unk> , because we 're not pushing the problem as we should .
And so there 's things .
A hospitable system where knowledge multiply each two or three years , and we do n't care .
Sleep deprivation deprivation deprivation deprivation .
And we ca n't get rid of it .
We have cognitive biases that allow them to make a perfect history of a patient with pain in their chest pain .
Now , let 's take the same patient with a chest grief , and he comes <unk> eyes with <unk> eyes and encouragement to alcohol and , all of a sudden , all of contempt .
It 's not the same story .
I 'm not a robot ; I do n't always do things the same .
And my patients are not cars ; they do n't want their symptoms forever .
For all of this , mistakes are inevitable .
So if we take the system as we were taught us , and we eliminate all the professional professionals error , well , you know , you 're not going to get anyone .
What about people do n't want to talk about the most serious cases ?
In my show : `` <unk> white art , black art , '' is already a saying , `` This is my worst mistake . ''
And their students are <unk> , <unk> , down the head , and they start to tell their stories .
They want to tell their stories , they want to share them .
<unk> power say , `` Look , do n't make the same mistake . ''
They need a context , they need context .
They need a <unk> medical culture .
And it starts with a doctor every time .
The `` We redefined redefined human being , you know , human beings , you accept it , and you 're not proud of your mistakes , but you wanted to learn from what 's happened to teach others .
It shares their experiences with them .
It 's support for those who talk about their mistakes .
It takes the mistakes of other people do n't with trying to catch up , but in a way , like a love and loving way and support for that all of the benefit .
And it 's working in a medical culture that recognizes human beings , and when this happens , they make mistakes they make .
My name is Brian Goldman .
I 'm a redefined redefined question .
I 'm a human , do mistakes .
And I 'm so sorry , but I 'm effort to learn to learn something that can transmit to others .
I do n't know what you think about me , but I can live with that .
And let me conclude with three personal words : I remember it .
Do you know how much decisions you do ?
Do you know how much we choose in a week ?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people , and the average number of elections , which says to choose an American American , is about 70 to a day .
It does n't really do much , in a research on a week from a week of companies .
Now , the researchers recorded the different tasks of these CEOs , and the time that we 're going to make decisions related to these things .
They found that on average , <unk> <unk> jobs a week .
Naturally , every work , many work , a lot .
Half those decisions took about nine minutes or less .
Only 12 percent required one hour or more of their time .
Now think of your choices now .
You know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes , how many of an hour ?
How do you care , how do you answer those decisions ?
Today I want to talk about one of the major problems of today : choosing the options .
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
As I talk about this , I 'm going to ask you a few questions , and I need to know your answers .
When I ask a question , I 'm a blind , raise your hand if you want to burn calories .
Otherwise , when you ask a question , if your answer is positive positive , please give me a <unk> .
And now my first question of day : Are you ready to hear about the bad problem of the bad options ?
Thank you .
Being a graduate student from at Stanford University , we would take this very , very high supermarket student at least at least at the time was very sophisticated .
It was called <unk> .
It was almost like going to an amusement park .
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard , and vinegar , more than 500 different fruits and vegetables , and just about 25 bottled water . And this was when we put on the faucet .
I loved going to that store , but one time I asked myself , why did I never buy anything ?
This is the olive oil shelf .
They had more than 75 different different classes , including those who were in sealed box that came from millennials .
I once decided I was visiting the manager , and I asked him , `` It works well this strategy of offering all these options ? ''
He pointed to me the buses that they came up every day , usually with their cameras , usually with their cameras .
So we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> .
hallway .
They had different kinds of different kinds of .
They put a post to <unk> , just to the entrance to the store .
We put it out there on six tastes about six tastes , or as long as different tastes different and you look at them two things : first , what people were willing to do , what do people have was willing to try and try and test it out ?
More people stopped when it was 24 -- 60 , 60 percent , when there were only six , 40 percent .
We also look at us in what case they were more likely to buy a jelly pot .
This is the opposite effect .
When they stopped when they had 24 , only three percent , only three percent was stopped buying up .
Where stopped when six , we saw that 30 percent .
If we do the calculations , people were six times more likely to buy jars if they found six .
Well , to decide that we do n't buy it , we probably want us to buy it , you know it 's a good thing to keep up with the <unk> , but it turns out that the problem costs the potential problem overload in a lot of choices .
We decided not to decide , even though this is not appropriate .
Now the issue of the day : financial saving .
I 'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Wei , where we 're looking at decision-making decisions about savings for about a million Americans from this country .
And we were interested in seeing if the number of funds are available in savings for retirement , retirement program , <unk> to people to save for the future .
And we found that there was a correlation .
We had <unk> plans that were from two , to 59 different options .
We found that the older number was the number of funds .
So if we look at the extremes , we see that in the plans that offer two funds , the rate of participation , the rate of participation , or more , as high as we look at it .
And in the plans that volunteered for about 60 funds , the rate of participation went down to the 1960s .
It turns out even if you decide , when there are more choices , even in that case , there 's negative consequences .
So , for those who decided to participate , the bigger was the number of choices , more people are going to be able to avoid the actions or hedge funds .
As long as there was more options , they were more willing to invest in the financial financial accounts .
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we 're going to <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being .
In the previous decade , we 've seen three main negative consequences by providing them and more possibilities .
The most likely thing is that we make the decision that we even know when it goes against self-interest .
They 're more likely to take the worst decisions , and in finance and health .
They 're more likely to pick up less satisfying things , even though they objectively they 're objectively better .
The main reason is that you 're looking at that <unk> variety , mustard and vinegar , and jelly , but you 're not able to do the calculations to compare and contrast and choose that amazing show .
Today I want to propose today , four simple techniques that we have tried to do , in one way or another , in different research , so that they can rehearse in their businesses .
The first one is , <unk> .
You 've heard it before , but it 's never been more true than today , which is less than today .
People are always upset when I say , `` <unk> . ''
They care about losing space in the <unk> .
But actually what we 're seeing every time is that if you decide to cut , get rid of weird redundant options get away , there will be a rise in sales , <unk> costs , your costs have a better deal in sales , <unk> .
When <unk> & Gamble went from 26 , <unk> different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15 , they saw a 10 percent increase in sales .
When the annual Golden Court became eliminated the products for cats <unk> that less being sold for profit , for two higher causes and lower costs .
You know , the supermarkets of today , the average , they offer 45,000 products .
In a Walmart store are offered a 100,000 thousand products .
But the largest store store the largest store in the world today is <unk> and <unk> -- a kind of <unk> tomato sauce .
In the financial savings world , I think that one of the best examples that have come to how to handle better choices is the choice is David <unk> , the Harvard program .
All Harvard employees all automatically believe automatically in a safe fund .
The people who really want to choose , are they offered 20 funds , not 300 or more .
You know , often people say , `` I do n't know how to cut .
These are all important options . ''
The first thing I do is ask the employees , `` Tell me the differences , you have between those choices .
And if their employees ca n't tell , they can not tell their customers . ''
This evening , before I start this session with Gary .
He said to me , he would be willing to offer people from this audience on vacation with all the world 's most beautiful road road .
Here , a description .
I want you to read it .
I 'm going to leave a couple of seconds for read , and then I want you to give it a hand if you 're ready to take the offer .
( Very few claps ) Okay . Anybody who 's ready to accept the offer .
Are they not more ?
Well , I 'm going to show you something else .
You know , there was a trick .
Who 's ready for that journey ?
I think I really had to hear more hands .
All right .
Actually , you had more information on the first round , that in the second , but I can tell you and say that you thought the second time was that .
Because the images they were making them more real .
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the machine overload problem , which is <unk> .
For people to understand the differences between choices , they need to understand the consequences of every choice , and that the consequences should be very vivid very , very concrete .
Why is people reason for 15 percent to 30 percent on average when they use debit cards for the credit for about 30 percent .
Because it does n't seem real money .
It turns out to look more real , it can be a very positive tool for people to save more .
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> who were working on <unk> -- these people were in a meeting , these people were in a meeting that they were in a meeting , a 401 plan .
At that point , we had to save exactly how we used , we made a small addition .
What we add was we appeal to the personal things that would think about the positive things that are going to be able to save in their lives if they were saving more money .
With this <unk> , there was a increase in 20 percent of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving , or what they wanted to put on their savings accounts , four percent increase , and an increase in the amount of savings accounts for the 20 percent .
The third technique is <unk> .
We can handle more than choices .
For example , this is a study we did in a journals of magazines .
We saw that in the grocery supermarket , we found that in the course of the northeast row of the northeast book , the magazine show can hold up from <unk> different types to <unk> .
But , you know ?
Because classification tells me how to figure it out .
These are two jewelry displays .
One is called `` <unk> , '' and the other , `` <unk> . ''
If you think that on the left is <unk> , and the one on the right is <unk> , they 'll give off , they 'll tap on it .
( few claps ) Okay , there are some applause .
If you think that on the left is <unk> , and the one on the right is <unk> , they 'll give off , they 'll tap on it .
Well , something else .
It turns out that it 's right .
The one on the left is <unk> and the right is <unk> . But you know something ?
This classification of classification is totally useless .
The categories must indicate something that we choose , not what defines them .
You often see this problem with these huge funds of funds .
I 'm afraid who are reporting ?
My fourth category do you create complexity .
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think , if we only make it a little bit .
We need to increase the complexity gradually .
I 'm going to show you an example of what I mean .
Let 's look at a complicated good decision , you buy a car .
This is a <unk> manufacturer of cars that allow them to completely <unk> .
You have to take 60 decisions , to assemble the car .
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one .
<unk> , <unk> color . I 'm 56 possibilities .
engine , box changes ; four options .
What I 'm going to do is vary to vary the order to make decisions .
So half the clients are going to go from many options , 56 colors , a few of four colors .
The other half of clients are going to go from a few options choices , four boxes , to 56 colors , many options .
And what am I going to look at ?
How involved you are .
If you 're always going by the default button in each decision , this tells you , you 're losing it .
We find that they go from many options a few options , push the default button over and again , and another .
We lose them .
If you go from a few choices options , you go on there .
The same information , the same number of options .
The only thing I did was disrupt the order to present .
If we start with how easy it , you learn to choose .
Although we pick up the box of change does n't say anything about the preferences of the interior decoration , anyway , a choice set up to choice .
We 're excited about a product that we 're building that now we have more engaged in the process .
Just to sum up .
I 've talked about four techniques to mitigate the machinery of choice overload : <unk> , weird alternatives , weird , weird choice : <unk> , you can make it real ; we can handle more categories out of any other choices : complexity , complexity .
All these techniques that I 've introduced to them were designed to help drive choices , or better , for you , to use them in their issues , or for the people who serve them .
I think the key thing to get the best thing about choice is being careful about choice .
And the more careful to be in our choices will better be able to practice choice .
Thank you very much .
In the 1980s , in the West , in communist Western Germany , if you had a typewriter that you had to write out of government .
You 'd have to register a sheet of text from the machine writing up with the machine .
And so that the government could track the origin of the texts .
If they were writing up with the wrong message , they could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea .
In the West , we do n't think that someone could do this , how much it would make the freedom of expression .
We would never do that in our countries .
But today , in 2011 , if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and print one page , that will end up with a few yellow dots on each page that they follow a pattern that makes a little print on each page that they follow it .
That 's happening today .
And no one seems very much like this .
This is an example of ways that our governments use technology against us , citizens .
And it 's one of three major causes of problems in the network .
If we see what happens in the online world , we can put the attacks according to their attackers .
There are three main groups .
There is the cybercriminals .
like Mr. Dimitry <unk> from Kiev in Ukraine .
The mobile phone is very easy phone .
These guys make money .
They use cyberattacks to make a lot of money , enormous numbers .
There are really a lot of millionaires millionaires .
This is RiSE <unk> , from <unk> , to Estonia , Estonia .
This is Alfred Gonzalez .
This is Stephen Watt .
This is <unk> <unk> .
These are Matthew Anderson , etc. , etc. , etc. , etc. , etc .
These guys do their fortunes , but they do it by illegal media using banking to rob money from banking trojans in order to steal from our keys .
The U.S. is the secret United States , two months ago , froze the Swiss account of this gentleman , Sam , Sam : Mr. Jain , and this note had <unk> millions of dollars when frozen .
Mr. Jain is rush ; he does n't know their stop .
And I say that today is more likely than any of us to be a crime victim .
And it 's very obvious that this is going from wrong .
In the future , most crimes are going online .
The second group of attackers in terms of it 's not motivated by money .
There 's another thing moving it , they 're going to motivate them , they motivate them , they motivate them , they motivate them , they motivate them .
Groups as Anonymous as Anonymous in the last 12 months , occupying a prominent role in online attacks .
Those are the three main issues of major : criminals who make it for money , <unk> <unk> that they do to protest and the last group is the national states that they attack .
And then we see cases like the <unk> .
That 's a good example of government attack against its own citizens .
<unk> is an evaluation of the Netherlands or , actually , it was .
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk> .
You 'll get the safety of the site and it perpetrated a <unk> .
Last week , I said , at a meeting with the Dutch government , I asked one of the leaders of the Dutch government to have found out of people if they could find babies to be able to cause people to cause their death to cause their death to cause themselves to have to cause them to be killed .
And the answer of it was yes .
So how people die of a cause of this ?
<unk> is an <unk> authority .
<unk> certified .
What are the certificates of the certificates ?
Well , you need a website if you have a website with <unk> , <unk> services , services like Gmail .
Except , we 'll make a foreign authority .
And they give birth certified .
And in the case of <unk> happened exactly that .
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened , for example , in Egypt ?
Well , in Egypt , the protesters based on the police headquarters police headquarters in April 2011 and during the State of the building , they found a lot of papers .
Among those papers was this folder called `` <unk> . ''
And within that folder , there was a company in a company with headquarters in Germany that he had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country is based on a large scale of citizens .
They had sold this tool for 40,000 euros to the Egyptian government .
The company headquarters just here .
I mean , Western governments provide tools for totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens .
But Western governments are also doing this .
For example , in fact , just a couple of weeks ago was found by the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> used by German government officials to investigate the German government , to investigate their own citizens .
If you 're suspicious of a criminal case , well , it 's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk> .
But now it goes beyond .
It <unk> the Internet connection .
Now , we even had tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer to infect you to see all the communication , and to hear the discussion , and listen online discussions , to get our data up .
When we think carefully about things like these , like these the obvious answer should be , `` Well , it looks a bad thing , but I really do n't think it 's a bad citizen .
Why worry ?
I have nothing to hide . ''
And that argument does n't make sense .
It 's in play privacy .
Privacy is not dispute .
It 's not a question of privacy against security .
It 's about freedom against control .
If we might be able to trust our governments today in 2011 , whatever , whatever right is going to be forever .
Any blind people in any future government , in a management that we could have in a 50 years ?
These are the questions that you have to worry about the next 50 years .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya , in the southern part of Nairobi National Park .
These are the cows of my dad , at the bottom , and behind the cows , the National Park in Nairobi .
The National Park of Nairobi does n't have fences in most of the South , which means that wild animals like zebras are freely banned out in the park .
And predators , like lions , like lions follow , and this is what they do .
<unk> our livestock .
This is one that they killed at night , and so soon we wake up in the morning , and we found it dead , I felt really bad felt really wrong because it was the only bull .
My community , the <unk> , we think we came from the sky with our animals and the whole land of the land for us , and so we value them so much .
And so , I grew up to hate lions a lot .
They died are a warriors that protect our community and livestock , and they 're also upset with the problem .
So they kill lions .
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi .
I think about this as few of Nairobi National Park .
A kid in my community , six to the age of nine at nine , is responsible for your father to be responsible for her father to be in .
So I had to find a way to solve this problem .
My first idea was to use fire , because I thought about lions lions fear .
But I realized that actually did n't help the lions , because he even helped the lions to see the shed on the far .
I did n't give up .
A second idea was to use a <unk> .
I was trying to trick the lions so they believed that she believed that he was near the pen .
But male lions are very smart ; they came up the first day and saw the <unk> , and they were , but the second day , and they said , `` This thing does n't move , it 's always right here . So it 's just gone up here . So I went down and killed animals .
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch , and that day lions did not come .
I found out male lions fear of the light that moves .
So I had an idea .
And I got a switch with which to turn the lights off .
And this is a little lamp lamp of a broken flashlight .
All right .
As you can see , the solar cell , the battery and the battery <unk> electricity to the small box , and I call it a transformative box .
And the <unk> box making lights .
As you can see , they 're <unk> , because that 's where lions come from lions .
And that 's how it looks like lions when they come from night .
The <unk> lights and <unk> lions so you think I 'm walking through the barn , but I 'm sleeping on my bed .
Thank you .
So I put them in my house two years ago , and since then , we never went back to having trouble with lions .
And the houses of the neighborhood heard , the idea .
One is from this grandmother .
And she had killed a lot killed the lions and asked if I could put the lights up .
I said yes .
I put them up . You can see the bottom , these are the lights for lions .
Since then , I 've set them up in seven houses in my community , and they 're just serving a lot .
And my idea is also used by all Kenya now , to scare other predators like hyenas like hyenas , it 's like hyenas , they 're also using it , and it 's also using it for scare elephants of farms .
Thanks to this invention , I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship in Kenya , <unk> International School , and I 'm very excited .
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk> .
It even led to my friends to my community , and we installed the lights in the houses they do n't have , and I teach them how to put them together .
So one year ago , it was just a kid on the meadows of the savanna my father 's cows , and I used to see flying airplanes , and I would like to see that one day fly in one day .
And today here I am .
I got an opportunity to come in airplane for the first time at TED .
My great dream is to get to be an engineer and a pilot is going to be able to be an engineer and a pilot is going to be able to be an engineer and a pilot is going to be able to be an engineer , aviation engineer to be a <unk> engineer and pilot growing up .
I used to hate lions , but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions and lions , we can be with lions without any conflict .
<unk> <unk> . What in my tongue means , thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : You do n't picture how exciting a story is that you can hear a story like you .
So you got a scholarship . Richard <unk> : Yeah .
CA : You 're working on other electrical inventions .
What 's the next on your list ?
<unk> : My next invention is -- I want to do an electric fence ? CA : An electric fence ?
<unk> : I know you already have invented electrical fences , but I want to do mine .
CA : So I 'll get it once , right ? You -- and you ... <unk> -- I 've tried it before , but I couple , because I got a <unk> . CA : On the top of the cannon . Richard -- Richard <unk> , Richard <unk> .
We 're going to take it on every step you give up , my friend .
Thank you very much . <unk> : Thank you .
When I was a small , I thought my country was the best on the planet .
And I grew up with a song called `` No <unk> . ''
And I was feeling so proud .
In school , we would spend all the history of Kim <unk> 's story , but we never learned a lot from the rest of the world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are our enemies .
Although I sometimes wondered about the rest of the world , I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea , until everything changed .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal .
My family was not poor , and I was n't starving .
But one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from my sister from my sister .
It would say , `` When I 'm going , the five members of the family will stop in this world , because we have n't eaten in the two weeks .
We 're <unk> together on the floor , and our bodies are so weak , we 're ready to die . ''
It was very altered .
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country .
At a short time , when I was walking in front of the train station , I saw something terrible that I ca n't erase from my memory .
A woman without life was dead in the street , holding a child <unk> in her arms looking at her face , watching nothing .
Nobody helped them , because they were very concerned with take care of themselves and their families and their families were .
A huge famine went straight to North Korea in the middle of the '90s .
At the end , over a million North Koreans , died during famine , and only few survived , eating the grass , the insects and the crust of the tree .
They also became more and more frequent <unk> , all over the dark night was completely dark at night except for sea lights in China , barely crossing the river from my home .
I always wondered why they had light and ourselves .
This is a satellite photograph from North Korea in the last night with the neighbors .
This is the <unk> River , which serves from North Korea and China .
As you can see , the river can be very narrow at certain points , allowing you to allow North Koreans to go in love .
But many die .
Sometimes I see bodies floating around on the river .
I ca n't reveal the details of how I went out from North Korea , but I can only say that for the years of famine to be sent to China , but I can only say that for the years of famine to be sent to China to live relatives . ''
But I just thought I 'd be separated from my family over short of time .
I could never have imagined that would take 14 years back to live .
In China , it was hard to live as a young woman woman .
I had no idea about what life would be like .
But I soon learned that it 's not just extremely difficult , but also dangerous , because refugee North Koreans in China were considered illegal immigrants .
So , I was living with a constant fear of my identity out of my identity , and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea , in North Korea .
One day , my worst nightmare became true , when I was arrested by Chinese police and <unk> at the police station .
Somebody had a accused of me , then I 'm going to <unk> my Chinese skills in the Chinese language , and they asked me a lot .
I was <unk> .
I thought my heart was going to blow up .
If it did n't seem natural , it could be incarcerated and <unk> .
I thought my life was going to end up .
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions .
At the end of the interrogation , a official report , he said to another , `` This is a fake report . She 's not <unk> . ''
And they stopped me . It was a miracle .
Some North Koreans in China seeking asylum in the foreign embassies .
But many may be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> .
These women were very lucky .
Although they had captured them , they were eventually released , they were eventually released international pressure .
These North Koreans were n't so lucky .
Every year , countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea , where they 're tortured , incarcerated or incarcerated or the public .
Even though I was lucky to escape , many other North Koreans have n't been so lucky .
It 's tragic tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle just to survive .
Even after learning a new language , and then finding work , all the world can do it in a moment .
That 's why , after 10 years to hide my identity , I 've decided I risk going to South Korea .
And I started a new life again .
You know , <unk> in South Korea was a lot more expected to expect .
English was very important in South Korea , I had to start learning my third language .
I also understood that there was a big gap between North and South .
We 're all the Koreans , but in the inside , we have become very different from 67 years of division of division .
I even went through an identity crisis .
Am I <unk> or <unk> ?
Where am I ? Who am I ?
Suddenly , there was n't a country I could call myself with pride .
Even though we would go back to South Korea , I did a plan . I started a plan . I started studying the university of university at university at university .
Just when they were starting to go back to my new life , I got an alarming call .
The North Korean authorities made some money that I sent to my family , and , as punishment , my family was going to be displaced to the force to a separate location outside the outside .
They had to run away immediately .
So I started planning how to help them escape .
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom .
It 's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea .
So , ironically , I took one flight to China , and I went to the North Korean border to North Korea .
Since my family could n't speak Chinese , I had to guide them , somehow , for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia .
The trip in <unk> took a week , and we were almost caught up in a number of times .
Once , our bus was arrested and address by a Chinese officer time .
And he was asking you all , and he started to ask you questions .
As my family could not understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .
When the Chinese official came up to my family , the impulse , I stood up and I told him , I said , were <unk> .
I looked at me <unk> , but fortunately I thought .
We made all the way up to the border 's border .
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe , to bribe , to bribe , to bribe , but I had to spend almost spending all of my money .
But even after passing the border , my family was arrested and incarcerated to cross the border illegally crossing .
After paying tickets and bribes , my family was released in a month .
But then , the family , my family was arrested and incarcerated again at the capital of Laos .
This was one of the lowest points in my life .
I made all of my family , and we were so close to , but my family was <unk> in prison to cut away from the South South to the South Korea .
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station , desperately trying to release my family .
But I did n't have enough money to pay more bribes or tickets more .
I lost hope .
At that point , or a man 's voice of a question , `` What is the problem ? ''
I was so amazed that a stranger would care to ask .
With my poor English and with a dictionary , I told him the situation , and without doubt , the man was to the ATM , the man was the ATM , and I gave me the rest of the money for my family and to get them out of prison .
I thank him with all my heart , and I asked him , `` Why am I help me ? ''
`` I 'm not helping , '' he said .
`` I 'm helping the village . ''
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life .
The nice unknown <unk> is a new hope for me and for the village , we needed the people .
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the international community 's support really are the rays of hope that the people are really the <unk> people need .
Over time , after our long trip , my family and I met in South Korea .
But achieving their freedom is only half a battle .
Many North Koreans are separated from their families , and when they go back to a new country , they start with little or nothing of money .
So , we can benefit from the international community to education , practices , English , work practice , and more .
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world .
Because many of us continue in contact with family , and we send information and money that 's helping to change North Korea , and we send the money that is helping to change North Korea .
I 've been very lucky , I 've received a lot of inspiration from my life , so I want to help North Koreans , so I want to help North Koreans , an opportunity to thrive with international support .
I 'm sure you 're going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> around the world , including the TED stage .
Thank you .
I live in the South Center .
This is South Center : <unk> stores , fast food , fast food , <unk> land .
So the city planners came together and thought , and they thought , we 're going to change the name of South Center so that it also represent something more , so they changed them to Los Angeles , as if this is really wrong in the city .
This is Southern Los Angeles , and <unk> , fast food , fast food .
Just as millions of other Americans , I live in a food desert , South and South , home of food , to take out of food , to bring and eating in the car places to get it and eat and eat in the car .
The funny thing is that the food places to get killed more people than food in the car .
People are dying of treatable illness in the South Center .
For example , the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than , say , `` Beverly , Beverly Hills , which is like 15 miles away .
I emphasize , I emphasize , this happens .
And I ask myself , how would you feel if you did n't have access to healthy food , and if every time you get out of the house look , the effects they 're looking at , the effects of what the current food system have to be in your neighborhood ?
I see chairs of wheels bought and sold as a used cars .
I see by dialysis dialysis centers like Starbucks .
And I think this must stop .
I think the problem is the solution .
Food is the problem , and it 's the solution .
He also got tired of driving 45 minutes back , and back to buy an apple apple that has no pesticides .
What I did , it was planting a food forest in front of my house .
In a sliver of a gardening .
It 's about 45 feet .
The point is , which belongs to the city .
But you have to keep it .
I said , `` Well , I can do what comes to me , because it 's my responsibility , and I have to keep it . ''
That 's what I decided to keep it up .
So my group and I , L.A. , <unk> <unk> , and we put together , and we started planting our food forest , <unk> trees , you know , nine complete vegetables .
What we do , we are a kind of paid group ahead of it made of gardeners of all of all the backgrounds , all of the whole city and completely volunteer , and everything we do is free .
And the garden was beautiful .
Then somebody complained .
The city I sat down on , and in short , gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden , the <unk> was made from judicial making .
And I said , `` Let 's go .
An order for planting food to plant food on a piece of land that nobody cares ? '' So I was like , `` Well , <unk> . ''
Because this time was not going to happen .
The Times Times had the story written by Steve <unk> , and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green <unk> members , who put a request on <unk> , having 900 firms , we were just successful .
We had the victory in our hands .
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and loved what we were doing .
I mean , we go , why do n't you ?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk> land .
It 's 68 miles of <unk> .
That 's the equivalent of 20 Central Central Parks .
That 's enough space for planting <unk> million <unk> .
Why on the hell do you do n't look good at this ?
It 's a plant to give a 1,000 , 10 thousand seeds .
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result .
It 's my anthem , when I tell people , your own food .
<unk> your own food is like printing your own money .
You see , I have a legacy , I 've got a legacy for South Center .
I grew up there . I 'm getting my kids out there .
I 'm glad to be part of this <unk> <unk> , and I 'm going to manufacture my own reality .
You see , I 'm an artist .
The gardening is my graffiti <unk> , I culture .
Such as an graffiti artist , like <unk> walls , I <unk> soils .
I use the garden , the land , as a piece of canvas , and plants , and the trees , are my <unk> on that canvas .
You 'd be surprised to see what the earth can do , if you let it be your canvas .
You just ca n't imagine how amazing the amazing thing is , and how it affects people .
What happened ?
I witnessed how my garden became an education tool , a transformation of my neighborhood .
To change the community , you have to change the composition of the land .
We 're the land .
You 'd be surprised to see how it affects kids .
<unk> is the most therapeutic act and provocative that you can do , especially in a <unk> .
Also , you get strawberries .
I remember one occasion , and his daughter came up with a mother and she was in my yard , went out and they were in my garden , went out and look at my garden , went out and look very closely at it .
I , well , good , man , I felt wrong , and I told you , I told you , you know , you do n't have to do this .
This is on the street for a reason .
I felt ashamed to see people that was so close to me with hunger , and this is only why I do this , people ask me , people ask , people ask , people ask , people ask , people really ask , people are going , `` End , do you do this people ? ''
What I say , `` Oh no God , I 'm not afraid you 're going to steal from stealing . ''
So that 's the street .
That 's what it is about .
I want you to take it , but your health want to take your health out . ''
There was another time that I put a garden in a shelter where they 're going in in Los Angeles <unk> .
They were these guys , who helped me download the truck .
It was fabulous , and they gave me their stories about how this had affected her and how they used to planting her to plant with her mom and her grandmother , and it was fabulous to see how this changed , so it was just just for a moment .
So Green <unk> has been planting maybe 20 gardens .
We 've had , like , about 50 people who come , work and participate , all in voluntary plan .
If kids are <unk> <unk> , the kids ate <unk> .
If you grow tomatoes , you 'll eat tomatoes , but if nothing is taught , if you 're not taught how food your mind affects your mind is that your mind affects your mind .
I see young people who want to work , but they have this thing in which they 're stuck . I see color boys who are in this path designed for them , which are on this path designed to them .
With the gardening , I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are coming from their communities to have a sustainable life .
And when we do this , who do you know ?
You may be able to produce the next George Washington thing .
But if we do n't change the composition of the land , we 're never going .
Now this is one of my plans , this is something I want to do .
I want to plant a whole block of gardens , where people can share food on the same block .
I want to take container and turn them into healthy coffeehouse .
Do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not talking about free stuff , because free is not sustainable .
So the curious thing about sustainability , is that you 've got to be <unk> .
What I 'm talking about is to put people out of the street , pull the kids out of the street , who know the joy , the pride and the honor and honor of growing their own food , opening by <unk> markets . ''
What I want to do here , is so sexy .
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> , <unk> , gardeners , <unk> .
We need to change the script of what 's a <unk> .
If you 're not a gardener , you 're not a <unk> .
You know , they 'll take them off their agreement ?
That 's his weapon weapon .
In the sum of , if you want to meet with me , you know , you 're not going to call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and sit in comfortable chairs and get meetings to talk about making some shit -- to talk about making some shit .
If you want to see me , you 'll come to the garden with your backhoe so that we can plant something .
Peace . Thank you .
Thank you .
( Sound of microwave ) You 'll all agree with me that this is a pretty nice road .
It 's made out of asphalt , and asphalt is a good material to drive , but it 's not always , especially in days as it as it is it .
You can have a lot of water on the tarmac that points .
And especially if you go set in your bicycle and these cars , it 's not very nice .
Also , asphalt can make a lot of noise .
It 's a noisy material material , and if we build roads , like the Netherlands , very close to cities , we want a quiet road .
The solution for that is to make top-down roads .
<unk> asphalt , a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands is the pores and the water can move through it , so the water can go through the sides of the rain can go down and have a road that 's ever gone longer .
Noise also disappear into these pores .
Because it 's very hollow out of it , all disappear , so it 's a very quiet road .
It also has a disadvantages , of course , and the disadvantage of this road can be undo .
What 's going to get away ? You see that on this road , the stones go out .
First of all , then several more and more , and more and more , and then -- well -- but then -- well , it wo n't do that .
And finally , this can also lead to more and more damage .
Sometimes they can create potholes .
Ah . It 's ready .
<unk> , of course , that you can become a problem , but we have a solution .
You can actually see what the damage appears in this material material .
It 's a porous tarmac , as I said , so you just have a little bit of <unk> between the stones .
Because of the guys , of the light , to oxidation , this <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the glue between <unk> , and you 're <unk> , and you 're <unk> , and you 're going out of <unk> .
So , if you drive down the road , you 'll get the <unk> -- like you saw here .
To solve this problem , we think of <unk> materials .
If we can make this material break , then we probably have a solution .
So what we can do is use of steel wool , from that to clean <unk> , and we can just cut out steel wool wool , and we can mix those little pieces with <unk> .
So , we have little pieces with little pieces of steel wool .
Then you need a machine , like the one you see here , that you use it to cook -- a induction for induction .
The induction can heat , especially steel , it 's very good at it .
So what you 've got to do is heat the steel , melt <unk> , <unk> flow by these <unk> , and the stones will flow back into the surface .
Today , I used an microwave oven , because I ca n't bring the big induction here on stage .
The microwave oven is a similar system .
I put it up , I 'm going to pull out what happened .
This is the show coming out now .
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples .
We tried a lot of samples out there , and then the government actually saw our results , and they thought , `` Well , that 's really interesting . We have to try it out . ''
So , they gave us a piece of road , 400 feet from the <unk> freeway , where we had to do a lane lane to test this material .
So that 's what we did there . You see where we were doing the road on the road , and then , of course , this road lasts several years , no harm .
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab .
We made the data that we get the samples , we put a lot of charge in them , then we got our rehabilitation machine to be able to test it out .
We can repeat this many times .
Well , in closing , I can say that we 've made a material using steel fibers , incorporating these fibers , using the induction energy to the surface , actually , increase the lives of the surface .
And now , of course , they 're curious about it also worked .
We still have the sample here . It 's quite hot .
It actually has to be cool first before I can show you how repairability does .
But I 'm going to make an attempt .
Let 's see . Yes , it worked .
Thank you .
When I was 11 , I remember , I remember one morning with the sound of <unk> in my home sound .
My father was listening BBC News on his little gray gray radio .
I had a big smile on his face that was unusual at the time , because the news generally <unk> .
`` The Taliban was left ! '' `` I screamed my father .
I did n't know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
`` Now , you can go to a real school , '' he said , `` I know . ''
One morning I 'll never forget .
A real school .
You see , I was six years old when the Taliban came in Afghanistan and made the girls go to school .
For the next five years , for the next five years , my older sister I would have no longer being alone , to go to a secret school .
It was the only way that we could both educate them .
Every day , we took a different route that nobody could be suspicious where we were going .
We had to hide the books in market bags so seem like it would seem like we were shopping .
School was in a house , over 100 of a little room .
It was nice in winter , but extremely hot in summer in summer .
We all knew we would take our lives , the teacher , the students and our parents and our parents .
Every once , the school suddenly had a week from a week , because the Pakistani Taliban .
We always wondered what they knew from us .
Was they following us ?
Did you know where we live ?
We were <unk> , but yet , the school was where we want to be .
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
A total factory in remote province of Afghanistan -- <unk> in that his daughter , my mother , was to school , so her father was going to school , and her father was <unk> .
But my mother mother became a teacher .
This is her .
He ran two years ago , only to turn our house into school for girls and girls and women in our neighborhood .
And my father , this is the first one of his family to receive education .
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education , even their daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
For him , there was a higher risk to educate their children .
For the years of the Taliban , I remember that there were moments in which I was very frustrated about our life , and I was always scared , and I did n't see a future .
I wanted to give up , but my father would say , `` <unk> , daughter 's daughter , you can lose whatever you have in life .
You can steal your money away ; you can force your house during a war .
But there 's one thing that always will be with you , what 's here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education to pay your education , we will . ''
So do you still want to keep going on ? ''
Today I 'm 22 .
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
Less than six percent of women 's women 's elderly more than high school , and if my family had not so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
Instead , I find myself here proud to graduate <unk> College .
When I went back to Afghanistan , my grandfather , who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate his daughters out to her girls , was one of the first to tell me .
He 's not just stuck in my university degree degree of my university degree , as well as I 'm the first woman , and I 'm the first woman , I take on the streets of Kabul .
My family believes in me .
I dream big , but my family has even bigger dreams for me .
That 's why I 'm the global ambassador of <unk> , a global campaign to educate women .
It 's why I cofounded that I cofounded <unk> , the first private school , a child in Afghanistan , a country that is still risky for girls to go to school .
What 's exciting is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to take advantage of the opportunity .
And I see their parents and their families who , like mine , <unk> by themselves , despite even even in front of a grim opposition in them .
As Ahmed . It 's not his true name , and I ca n't show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
Less than a month ago , he and his daughter would go on from <unk> to his village , and literally , out of course out of being charged by being killed by a bomb on the road , for minutes .
When you get to your house , you 're the phone , a voice had noticed that if I was still sending out to his daughter at school , would come back and try .
`` <unk> , if you want , '' he said , `` but it does n't hurt my daughter 's future of my old and <unk> and <unk> ideas . ''
What I 've realized is that Afghanistan , and it 's something that is often forgotten in the West , is that behind most of us who we <unk> , there is a father who recognized , there 's a father who recognized the value of their daughter 's value of her daughter 's value .
It does n't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success .
In fact , they are often the first compelling clue of the brilliant future of their daughters , and in the context of a society like Afghanistan , we need the support of men .
With the Taliban , the girls who went to school , they count in hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
But today , over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan is so different from here in the United States .
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes .
And I 'm afraid these changes would n't last very long , after the retirement troops .
But when I go back to Afghanistan in my school , I see students in my school and their parents who were going to encourage them , that the pinnacle , I see a <unk> future and a lasting change and lasting change a future <unk> and a lasting change .
To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and endless possibilities , and every day of <unk> , remember me .
Like me , they dream up big .
Thank you .
I never have never ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in exile : `` <unk> , resists Gaddafi . <unk> him .
But never you go back a revolutionary sort of revolutionary style . ''
It 's almost two years since that was called the <unk> revolution , inspired by mass <unk> , both from the Tunisian revolution .
A forces with many other citizens <unk> , inside and outside of the country to call a <unk> day and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of Gaddafi .
And we succeeded . It was a big revolution .
Women and young men were at the cutting edge , pushing each of the regime , carrying up billboards , carrying themselves from freedom , dignity and social justice .
You 've shown an bravery <unk> when you faced the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi .
They 've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Far East , from the Far East , to the South .
Finally , after a period of six months of brutal war , and about about 50,000 people in about 50,000 dead people , we have been able to release our country and overthrowing the tyrant .
However , Gaddafi left a heavy load , a legacy of tyranny , corruption and focus of disruption .
For four decades , the distorted regime of Gaddafi destroyed the infrastructure , the culture and the moral structure of society .
Be aware of the devastation and challenges , I 've loved , next to many other women , rebuild the civil society , and just towards democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation , you 're going to have a inclusive transition .
There was roughly about 200 organizations in <unk> during , and immediately after all of the Gaddafi , it was about 300 to <unk> .
After a 33 years after a period of 33 years of exile , I went back to Libya , and I went back to Libya , and I started to organize workshops about the capability of capabilities , and leadership skills .
With an amazing group of women , we started by the Women of Women Women , a movement of women , very diverse , to advocate for a very diverse human group , to advocate for the <unk> women of the woman and peace .
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> , which are <unk> from selfish policies and exclusion .
Over time , our initiative was successful and successful .
The women won a <unk> percent of Congress in the first elections in 52 years .
However , little bit of a little bit , the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole , disappearing all the days of violence .
One day , we woke up with the news of the former ancient mosques and graves and Neanderthals -- and we woke up one day with the news .
Another day one day with the American ambassador and the murder of the American ambassador .
Another day we woke up with the news of the Army murder of the Army .
And every day , we woke up with the militia in the militia and their clothing of the human rights of prisoners and their lack of prisoners of the law .
Our society , made by a revolutionary mindset , and it 's grown from the ideals of ideals and principles of freedom , dignity , social justice .
The intolerance , exclusion , and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution .
I 'm not here today at all to inspire us with our history of the <unk> list and elections .
I 'm going on here today to confess that we as a nation , we 're choosing , we make the wrong decision .
We do n't prioritize .
Because elections did not brought peace , the stability and stability to Libya .
So the <unk> list and candidates between candidates and candidates of candidates ?
No , they did .
What happened then ?
Why is our society , and we 're dominated with selfish policies and dominance with selfish and exclusion for men ?
Perhaps what was missing was not just the women , but the women 's values of compassion , mercy and inclusion .
Our society needs national dialogue and the creation of more consensus about what the election needed is to just just put the polarization and division .
Our nation needs the qualitative representation of the other <unk> -- the kind of quantitative representation .
We need to stop acting as an outrage and calling days days of anger .
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy .
We have to develop a feminine speech , not just <unk> , but also to put mercy in place in place of revenge , collaboration , rather than exclusion instead of exclusion .
These are the ideals that such that an Libya , shattered war , desperately need to achieve peace .
Because peace has a alchemy that tries to give the <unk> between female and male .
That 's the real <unk> .
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk> .
All right with a verse from the Koran `` <unk> '' -- the peace word , `` <unk> , compassionate , ] . ''
At the same time , the word `` <unk> , '' which is known in all the <unk> traditions , it 's the same root itself that the word `` <unk> '' -- it 's the same root as the word `` <unk> '' -- that spans of the humanity that all of the people and all the people people , and all the people and all the people people
And so , just like the uterus completely covers , that grows inside , the divine matrix of compassion and compassion , all the very very divine matrix of compassion .
So it 's like , `` My mercy is all . ''
So it 's like , `` My mercy does about my anger . ''
That everybody is going to forget the grace of mercy .
Thank you .
I 'm here today to talk to you about a disturbing question , which you have an equally disturbing answer .
It 's about the secrets of domestic violence , and the question I 'm going to address the secrets of the domestic violence , why she 's left ?
Why would someone go to stay with a man who sticks ?
I 'm not a psychiatrist , no social worker , no expert , no expert in violence .
I 'm just a woman with a story to tell .
I was 22 . I had just <unk> at Harvard at Harvard .
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and publisher in <unk> magazine .
I had my first apartment , and my first apartment green green was green , and I had a very big secret .
My secret was that many , many times , the man , that I create my twin soul , was going on with my head with my head with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The man , the guy who loved one gun in this world , put a gun in my head and he threatened to kill me more times as I can remember to myself .
Now , I 'm here to tell you the story of `` crazy love , '' a psychological trap , in love of love , where they fall every year , and then , some men .
Until it could be your story .
I do n't look like a typical survivor of violence .
I 'm <unk> at Harvard University in Harvard , and I have an MBA at <unk> Business School .
I 've spent most of my career working for companies of `` Fortune 500 500 , '' which is a Johnson & Johnson list , Leo <unk> and The Washington Post .
I 've been to almost 20 years with almost 20 married my second husband , and we have three kids .
My dog is a black <unk> , and I lead a <unk> Odyssey .
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anybody , all races , all of the race income and education and education levels .
It 's everywhere .
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence is going to women .
Not exactly .
More of about 85 percent of men are men , domestic abuse only happens in intimate relationships , interdependent and long duration -- or , in the families , in the families , we 'd want to find violence ; it 's why , by which , domestic abuse it is a <unk> .
I myself would have said that it would be the last person in the world that he would sit with a man who sticks it , and actually I was a very typical victim of my age .
I was 22 years old , and in the United States , the women of ages by 16 and 24 is three times , they have three times as a child of domestic violence victims than the other ages , and over 500 ages and girls are in that age , are killed every year for couples , quotes and abusive , in the United States .
I also was a typical victim victim , because I knew nothing about domestic violence , his warning signs or their warning signals or their warning signs or their warning victim .
I met <unk> on a cold night cold night .
I was sitting next to my side in New York subway and started with me with me .
He told me two things .
The first one was that was just <unk> from a university on college , and he was working in a very important bank of Wall Street .
But what struck me most about in that first encounter was it , it was ready and fun , and it seemed like a kid in the countryside .
It had some big little bit like apples , and a <unk> hair and looked so sweet .
One of the smartest of the most intelligent things he did is to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate .
He did it above all <unk> on a pedestal .
We started out and loved everything of me , who had gone to Harvard , that I 'd gone to Harvard , that I 'd go to Harvard girls who put teenagers , and my job .
I wanted to know all about my family , my childhood , my dreams and illusions .
<unk> believed in me as a writer , as a woman , like nobody had ever done .
And that was why the bachelor 's degree in that Big school and the work on Wall Street and the brilliant future they had so much importance for him .
I did n't know that first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is seduced and <unk> to the victim .
And I did n't know that second step is <unk> .
Now , the last thing that I wanted to do was to go from New York , and let my dreams of my dreams , but I thought you 'd have to make your own sacrifices sacrifices , but I thought you had to make your own sacrifices sacrifices , but I thought I 'd quit my job and so I accepted , and I did accepted .
I had no idea that he was falling into a crazy love of `` crazy love , '' which was entering a head physical , financial , very carefully financial , very carefully financial .
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to .
And here 's where those guns come in .
As soon as we move to New England , you know , that site where you 're supposed to be able to feel so sure you had to feel so sure was three guns .
I had one of the <unk> in the car .
Another that kept on the pillow of it underneath our bed , and the third always in your pocket .
And he said that he needed those guns to cause the trauma lived from small .
I needed them to feel safe .
But those guns were actually a message to me , and even though I 've never got up my hand , my life was already in danger , every minute every day .
The first physicist physicist <unk> happened five days before our wedding .
It was seven in the morning , and I still had put the <unk> .
Five days for five bruises on my neck had disappeared , I put my mother 's girlfriend and married me with him .
In spite of what had happened , I was sure that we were living happily , because , because I loved him and he loved it too much .
And it was very , very regretted .
There was just a very pressing sense of a wedding , and by making a family with me .
It had been a isolated accident , and I 'd never do harm .
I spent two times on our honey moon .
The first time I was driving up at a secret beach and lost me , and he gave me so strong on the head that we would spend several times against the car window .
And then , a couple of days later , driving around our honey moon , and threw myself a Big Mac cold to the face .
<unk> continued to write one or twice a week for the next two years and a half of our marriage .
I would tell you when I thought it was the only one in this situation .
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying at some time in their life , and the Center for Disease Control , that every year 15 million children are <unk> , 15 million children .
So , actually , really good company .
Let 's go back to my question : Why did I get back to my question ?
The answer is straightforward .
I did n't know he was abusing me .
Instead , I was a very strong woman , in love with a profoundly <unk> man , and I was the only person in the world who could help you with their demons .
The other question that everybody does is , why is n't going to ?
Why did n't I go ? I could have gone at any time .
For me , this is the saddest and painful question that people do , because we , the victims of them , we know something that normally you ignore : it 's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk> .
Because the last phase of domestic violence is to kill her .
More than 70 percent of the murder of domestic violence happens after the victim has stopped the relationship to the ratio , after getting out , because then the <unk> has no anything to lose .
Other repercussions include the permanent harassment , even after the <unk> has become married , <unk> of financial resources , for financial resources , to <unk> the family court , which they are usually forced by judges to spend time for spending time .
And we still keep asking why it 's just not going ?
I was able to go , because of one last <unk> beat my denial beat .
I realized that the man who I loved so much , would have killed me if I had allowed it to allowed .
So I broke the silence .
I told it to everybody : the police , my neighbors , my neighbors , my friends and family , full of unknown , and I 'm here today because all of you , you helped me .
We have the tendency to prescribe the victims as scary as scary , damaged headlines .
The question , `` Why is it left ? ''
For some people , it 's a way to say `` guilt is yours by staying , '' as if the victims of the victims intentionally want to destroy them .
But since I published , I 've heard hundreds of men , and I 've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also escaped , who learned a lesson whether they 've learned what happened to them and they were engaging their lives lives from what happened to them and that they would bring their lives joyful lives and happy them like themselves .
Because it turns out , actually I 'm a victim and a survivor of domestic violence .
I became marrying a man cute man guy and then have those three children .
I have that black blob , and also that <unk> .
What I 'm not going to have never ever have , ever , is a gun gun pointing to my head in someone who says she wants to .
Right now , you 're the same thinking , `` <unk> , that 's fascinating ! '' or `` <unk> , what stupid it was . ''
I assure you there are a few people who are listening to me right now , who are being abused me or being battered , who are being abused or being abused .
<unk> could be affecting his daughter , his sister , to her best friend right now .
I was able to end my crazy love crazy love of silence .
And I keep doing it today .
It 's my way to help other victims , and it 's my last request .
Talk about what you 've heard about here .
<unk> thrives only in silence .
They have the power of domestic violence to just throwing light about it .
We need the victims we need everybody .
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence .
Take the abuse of the light , talking about it with your children of work , their friends and family friends , their friends and family friends .
They put their vision of survivors as fantastic and charming , who have a full future .
And we would have the early signs of violence to intervene consciously , to slow down their climb , and to show the victims for sure .
Together , together we can convert our tables and our tables and our families in the safe oasis should be .
Thank you .
Hi . I call myself Cameron Russell , and for a time ago , I 'm model .
To be precise , for 10 years .
And I feel like at this moment there is an awkward tension in the room because I should n't have dressed like this , like , luckily , I 'm wearing clothes .
This is the first shift in clothing on a TED stage , so you have a lot of luck .
If some of the women were horrified when I come up , you do n't have to get it right now , but I 'll figure it out later on Twitter .
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds .
Not everybody has that opportunity .
These heels are very uncomfortable -- but less bad I do n't use them anymore .
The worst part is going to spend this sweater away from me , because when you 're going to laugh at me , so do n't do anything while you cover your head .
All right .
Why did I do this ?
It 's been embarrassing .
Well , I hope not just like this picture .
The appearance is powerful , but also shallow .
I have completely changed what they thought about in six seconds .
And in this picture , I had never had a boyfriend in real life .
I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer told me to take my back back and put the hair back .
Of course , except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I 've done two days ago for the work , there 's very little , so we can do to transform our way , which , though , <unk> and unchanging , has a huge impact on our lives .
So today , being courageous today means to be honest .
I 'm on this stage because I 'm a model .
Because I 'm a beautiful woman beautiful woman , and in my workforce , that 's being a sexy girl .
I 'm going to answer the questions that people always do , but really honest .
The first question is , how is it going to be a model ?
And I always say , `` A <unk> me discovered , but that does n't mean anything .
The real reason that I made a model that I won the genetic lottery , and I 'm the benefit of a heritage , and you may be wondering what this heritage is .
Well , in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty , and youthfulness and symmetry , which we are biologically hardwired to admire , we are also associated with a high one , and <unk> figure , <unk> shape and white .
And that 's my heritage , heritage that I 've heard about to make money .
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now shown now skeptical , and maybe there are some of the <unk> lovers to say -- wait . There are Naomi , <unk> , Joan <unk> , Wen <unk> , Joan <unk> , Wen <unk> , Joan <unk> , unsustainable .
First of all , you know so much of the models of the models , it 's amazing .
But unfortunately , unfortunately , I have to report that in 2007 , a Ph.D. student from New York 's University , told us all and each of the models on the runway , and of the <unk> models , just 27 , less than four percent , not white .
The next question that people always do is : Can it be bigger model when you get older ?
And my first answer is : I do n't know that .
But then what I would tell each of these girls is : Why ? You can be anything you want .
You can be president of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a poet <unk> <unk> and poet , which would be impressive .
If after this spectacular list , you still insist , no , no , no , Cameron , `` Cameron , '' so I tell you , I 'm going to tell you , I know my boss .
Because I 'm not in charge of nothing , and you could be the head of writing from American magazine or the executive director of H & M & M ' director , '' or the next Steven & M magazine .
To say that you want to be a model that 's like saying you want to win the lottery when you 're bigger .
It 's out of your control , it 's amazing , and it 's not a job you can choose .
I 'm going to show you all I 've learned in 10 years as a model , because , unlike the <unk> surgery , you can be summarized right now .
I do n't know what happened there .
Sadly , once you 've already done your studies run , and you have a rsum and a couple of jobs and work on your backs on your backs , no matter what you say , if you told it , you 're saying , you said , `` Model your underwear of the United States , '' people , people would look weird .
The next question that people always do is , if all the pictures do you know .
And yes , pretty much <unk> all the photos , but that 's just a small part of what happens .
This was the first picture that you took , and also the first time I used a bikini , and I did n't even even have my period first time .
I know that we 're entering the personal ground , but it was a little girl .
This is this next to my grandmother a few months before .
These two pictures are of the same day .
My friend came with me .
Here I am at a pajama party a few days before the pictures for French <unk> .
Here I am with my football team and in the V magazine .
And this is me right now .
And I hope you realize it 's not me in those photos .
They 're creations of a group of professionals , <unk> , <unk> , photographers and <unk> , and all <unk> people and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> people and <unk> , and they get them , and that 's not me .
Well , the next question that people always do , is : Are you doing things for free ?
I have too many heel heels and I never use , except the two previous pair , but the privilege that I get the privilege that I get in real life , and we do n't like to talk .
I grew up in Cambridge , and I once went to a store and I forgot about taking money , and I was given my money free .
When I was a teenager , I traveled with my friend , I was a very bad driver , and , of course , a red light driver , of course , in a red light , and , of course , you stood up with , and it took an agent , and so I can keep up on driving .
I love the love of these privilege by me , not so much what I am , and people who are paying a price for a price look like what it looks like who are .
I live in New York City , and last year , of the teenage girls who stood in and <unk> , 86 percent black and Latino , <unk> , <unk> , and most of them were young men .
And there are only black and Latino , in New York , and Latino for them , is not a question of <unk> ?
But how many times me ?
By looking at this talk , I learned that to 53 percent of the age of 13 years in the United States , you do n't like their body , and that figure rises to 78 percent .
So , the last question that people do is : How is it a life of a model ?
And I think the answer they 're waiting for is : If you 're a little thinner , you have the brightest hair feel very happy , and feel very happy .
And behind the cameras , we give them an answer that maybe look like that .
We say , it 's really wonderful to travel , and also incredible to work with creative people with creative people with creative people .
And all of that is true , but it 's just a part of what 's going on , because what we 're never in before , is : I 'm insecure .
And I 'm because I have to worry about my day every day .
And if you 've ever ask you , if you 've ever ask , you 've got some thinner legs and the brightest hair , will be happier ?
They only have to meet a bunch of models of models , because they have the thinner legs , the brightest hair hair and clothes , but probably it 's the most safe women are physically out on the planet .
But especially it was hard to analyze a race of racial and gender , when I 'm one of the elderly .
If there is something that you have to retain this talk , I hope that you 're all more comfortable to recognize the power of the image of the image in your sense of success and failure .
Thank you .
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to hold a camera , but I want to share with you my 15 hundred pictures , and I do n't know today , with my 15 little photos . ''
There was no artistic directors , no <unk> , no opportunity , no opportunity to repeat photos , not even a minimum care of the lighting was very much the lighting up .
In fact , most of them took them out tourists .
My story begins when , <unk> in New York City , to give you a lecture , my wife , my wife out of this picture holding my daughter on his first birthday , and that 's the corner of 57 and five . ''
He happened to happen back to New York just one year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Well , you can imagine what comes right now .
When I was approaching my third birthday of my daughter , my wife said , `` Why do n't you get to New York City on a <unk> trip and stick on the ritual ? ''
This is when we start to ask for tourists that were happening to us .
It 's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal .
No one has been denied , and fortunately , no one has ever been denied with the camera .
So , we were n't aware of how much life would change this journey this journey on .
It became something sacred for us .
This picture is a few weeks after <unk> , and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day , so a five-year-old girl could understand it .
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey .
It 's also a way to stop the time on a October week and we think about our time and our evolution over the years , and not only at the physical level , but in all of the senses .
Because , even though we always take the same picture , our view changes , my daughter takes new milestones , and I can see life through his eyes and how you see and interact with everything .
That particular time that we go through together is something that we expect with illusion all the year .
Recently , in one of the trips , we were walking around , when all of a sudden , just pointed out , actually stopped a red <unk> of the grocery store that I loved a little bit in <unk> visits .
And he described to me what made sense at the age of five feet in that same place .
<unk> that he remembered his heart <unk> to see that place for the first day nine years ago .
And now what 's looking at in New York now , it 's universities , because he 's determined to study in New York City .
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we create are the memories .
So , I want to share the idea of actively being active in the conscious creation of memories .
I do n't know you , but besides these 15 pictures , I do n't go out in many of these 15 family pictures .
I 'm always the picture that you get out .
Today I want to encourage everyone today 's picture , and you do n't get to somebody and ask somebody , `` Do you get a picture ? ''
Thank you .
I 'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
You get them in the group of more threatened birds .
First of all , why do you have so bad press ?
It has also been associated with Disney laughs , <unk> , stupid , stupid characters .
More recently , if you 've been following the press <unk> laughter laughter and applause them , applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Kenyan Parliament -- but I do n't accept it .
I do n't accept it . You know why ?
Because the members of Parliament do not clean the environment , <unk> them do not help prevent the spread of disease .
They hardly become monogamous . They 're far from extinct . And my favorite ones , they have better presence , there are two types of rabbits on this planet .
There is the New World 's New World , mainly in the Americas , like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and the Old World Science , where we have 16 species -- from these 16 species , face a high risk , of these 16 species .
So , why do respect matter ? First of all , they provide life services , they provide life services .
It 's our natural trash of nature .
<unk> the carcasses to the bone .
They help kill all the bacteria , they help them to absorb anthrax , and causing them to absorb the anthrax , and caused huge losses of livestock and diseases of other animals .
Recent studies have shown that in the areas where there is no solace , the bodies take three at four times , they have a <unk> , and they have a <unk> , and this has a huge ramifications of disease disease .
Now it also have huge historical importance .
They 've been associated with ancient Egyptian culture .
<unk> was the symbol of the protector and the maternity , along with the king cobra and <unk> Egypt .
In the Indian mythology , <unk> was the god <unk> , and risked his life to save the devil goddess in the 10 heads of <unk> heads .
In the <unk> culture , they 're very important about burials to open the open sky , and in places like Tibet , there is no place to bury the dead , or wood for <unk> , so that these rabbits provide a natural disposal system .
What 's the problem with substance ?
We have eight species of vultures in Kenya , which six are in extreme endangered .
The reason is that they 're being poisoned , and the reason that they 're being poisoned , is because there are conflicts between humans and wildlife , using this poison communities use this venom against predators , as a consequence , the rabbits are the victims of this .
In South Asia , in countries like India and Pakistan , four species of rabbits are in the critical endangered list , which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> , and the reason is because they fall in less than 10 or 15 years , and the reason is because they fall out of a drug like <unk> .
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India , and they 've taken a position .
Since there is no vultures , there has been a spread on the number of dogs on the street in landfills , and when you have dogs on the street , you have an enormous amount of time bomb up . The number of anger has increased enormously in India .
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa : <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake Turkana .
I 'm not against wind 's power , but we need to work with governments , because the wind turbines does this , the birds -- they cut them in half .
They 're <unk> .
In Western Africa , a horrible <unk> of dead people to serve the <unk> and the market of <unk> .
So what is it ? Well , we 're looking at these birds . We 're <unk> transmitters .
We 're trying to determine its basic ecology , and see where they go .
We can see that they travel across different countries , so you can focus on a problem locally is not going to serve anything .
We need to work with governments at regional levels .
We 're working with local communities .
We 're talking to them about appreciate that , about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide .
How can you be able to help ? It can become active , make noise . You can write a letter to your government and tell you , you have to focus on these very <unk> creatures ; it 's going to take your time to spread the word .
When you go out of this room , you 'll tell you about them , but talk to your families , with your children , with your own families , with your neighbors from your neighbors .
They 're very elegant . Charles Darwin said that he changed , because he saw them flying without effort , without energy spending in the heavens .
Kenya , the world , being a lot more poor without these wonderful species .
Thank you very much .
Every single thing I do and everything that I do professionally -- my life has been molded by seven years of <unk> in Africa .
From 1971 until 1977 . <unk> young people , but I 'm not working in Zambia , and I worked in Zambia , Kenya , Ivory Coast , Algeria , Ivory Coast , Algeria and Somalia .
I worked for an Italian NGO , and every project that we set up in Africa in Africa .
And I was disturbed .
I thought , at the age of 21 , that was good people , and we were doing a good job in Africa .
Instead , everything we did is we played it .
Our first project , which inspired my first book , `` <unk> of <unk> , '' was a project where a Italians decided to teach people about Zambia to grow food .
So , we came up with Italian seeds , south from Zambia to this utterly magnificent valley , and we teach local , Italian grow and we teach the Italians , Italian grow and the <unk> grow .
Now , of course , people were not at all at all who were at all , so they were going to work to work , and so they were going to work to work , and they were sometimes , and they do n't go to work . We were amazed at the local , and sometimes , they did n't have agriculture .
However , instead of asking the question , we just said , `` We just said , `` Thank God we are here . ''
And of course , it was all in Africa .
We got these magnificent tomatoes place . In Italy , a tomato tomato , and in Zambia , into this size .
And we could n't believe it , we were saying , `` Look how easy it is to be agriculture . ''
When the tomatoes were nice , mature , mature and red , overnight , about 200 <unk> came from the river and ate everything , and we said to the <unk> , and we said to the <unk> , `` Oh my God , <unk> ! ''
And the <unk> said , `` Yes , that 's why we do n't have agriculture here . '' `` Why do n't they say it ? ''
I thought we just saw the Italians would make mistakes in Africa , but then , I saw what the Americans were doing , what they were doing in the English , what they were doing the French , and then they see what the French did , and I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia .
Because , as you see , at least we feed them .
Let me see the waste -- we 're going to see the waste that we would give them to the <unk> people in Africa .
He wants to read a book called <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> economist .
The book was published in 2009 .
We , we , Western donors , we have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years .
I 'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has caused money .
Just read your book .
<unk> part of an African woman , the damage we 've done .
The Westerners are imperialists , missionaries <unk> , and we treat people just in two ways , or we 're unaware of people , or we 're planning , or we 're <unk> .
The two words come from the Latin root `` <unk> , '' which means `` father . ''
And yet , they mean two different things .
<unk> , I deal with any of a different culture , like my children . `` I want you a lot . ''
<unk> , I try all of a different culture , like my servants .
So white people in Africa are called `` <unk> , '' chief .
That book gave me a slap in the face . `` The small is beautiful , '' who said for <unk> , if people do n't want to be helped , if people do n't want to be helped , whether people do n't want to be helped , alone .
This is supposed to be the first beginning of help .
The first principle of aid is respecting .
This morning , the guy who opened this conference , put a stick on the floor and said , `` Can you -- you can imagine a city that 's not <unk> ? ''
I decided for the 27 will just answer to people , and he invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you 're never starting anything , but you 'll actually get a servant of the local passion , the servant of the local passion , the servant of the local people who have a dream of becoming a better person .
So what does you do ? It 's <unk> .
Never get a community with an idea , and you sit with the people in the seat .
We do n't work from offices .
We met in a cafe . We met in a bar .
We have zero infrastructure .
And what do we do ? We become friends , and we find out what the person to do .
The most important thing is passion .
You can give somebody an idea .
If that person does n't want to do that , what are you going to do you ?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing .
The passion that man has to own personal growth is more important .
And then we help find out knowledge , because no one in the world can be successful only .
The person with the idea can not have knowledge , but knowledge is available .
So years and years ago , I had this idea : Why do n't we have a community to tell people what to do , why do n't we have a community to tell people what to do , why do n't it , for once , for you ?
I 'll tell you a secret .
There 's a problem with community meetings .
The entrepreneurs never opened up , and they will never say , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what they want to do with their own money .
So , planning has this blind spot .
People who are smarter in their community , you do n't even know it , because they did n't reach their public meetings .
What do we do ? We work one way , and we work on the face , you have to create a social infrastructure , which does n't exist .
You must create a new profession .
The profession is the family 's family of business , the business 's family 's family , and they set up with you at home , at the table of their kitchen , in your kitchen table , and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a form of a living .
I started this as a test in <unk> , city of Western Australia .
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time , trying to get away from this condescending waste , where we get to tell them what to do .
In a year , I had 27 projects going , and the government came to me to see , `` How can you do that ? ''
How can you do it ? '' And I said , `` I did something very , very hard .
And I shut them down . '' So , the government 's going to say `` Do it again . '' We 've made it in 300 communities , in the world .
We 've helped to start 40,000 businesses .
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs that are dying of loneliness .
Peter <unk> , one of the greatest business advisers in history , passed away to '96 , a few years ago .
Peter <unk> a professor of philosophy before , in business , and this is what Peter <unk> says , `` planning is actually incompatible with a society and an innovative company economy . ''
Now , planning is the kiss of entrepreneurship .
So now , <unk> reconstructing Christchurch , without knowing what the most <unk> people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy .
You have to learn how to get these people come to talk with you .
You have to offer you nice , privacy , and you have to be fantastic as you can help you , and then add it , it will come in mass .
In a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , intelligence and passion ?
What do you show you more than tomorrow ?
People are passionate about passionate . That 's what you 're doing .
So , what I 'm telling you is that the entrepreneur is where it is .
We 're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we 're at the end of the first <unk> industrial revolution , and for a moment to another , we have systems that are not sustainable .
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
<unk> as a way to sustain machinery is not sustainable .
What we need to consider , is how <unk> , we heal , we do , we have to study seven billion people , on a sustainable way of people , on a sustainable way .
There are no technologies to do it .
Who 's going to invent the technology for the green revolution , universities ? Forget it !
The government ? Forget it !
They 'll be the entrepreneurs and they 're doing it now .
There 's an adorable story that I read in a futuristic magazine many years ago .
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the New York City in the Year of 1860 .
And in the year 1860 , got together this group of people , and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York City in 100 years , and the conclusion was <unk> : New York City would n't exist within 100 years .
Why ? Because they analyzed the curve and they talk , if the population is keeping up to this rate , to move to the population of New York City , and the manure produced by six million horses , and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address .
They were already born in dung , so they were <unk> , so in 1860 , they were making this dirty little technology that we can bring in New York lives .
So what happens ? Over the next 40 years , in 1900 , in the United States , the United States appeared -- companies , companies .
The idea of finding a different technology is that it was absolutely absorbed , and there were very few , <unk> , factories in <unk> places .
Dearborn , Michigan . Henry Ford .
However , there 's a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First , you have to offer you guys .
Otherwise , they wo n't have a conversation with you .
Then , you have to offer you absolute , dedicated , dedicated , <unk> .
And later , you 'll have to tell you the truth about it , and take it out .
The smallest company , the largest company , has to be able to do three <unk> : the product that you want to sell it have to be a fantastic thing , you have to have a lot of good stuff , you have to count with a fantastic marketing , and you have to tell with a fantastic marketing management .
You know what ?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can be able to sell and look at the money only .
It does n't exist .
This has not been born .
We 've looked at and look at the 100 companies like Carnegie companies , Westinghouse , Edison , Ford , all the new Google companies , Google , Yahoo .
There is just one thing that all of a success companies in the world have in common , only one : no one was started by a single person .
Never the word `` me , '' but the word `` us , 32 times . ''
He was n't just when he started .
Nobody starts a company alone . Nobody .
So , we can create the community where we have facilitators , who come from an facilitators of small businesses , sitting in cafes together and in bars with their dedicated dedicated who who will do for you , what someone did for this gentleman , who did this for this gentleman who talks about it , what someone did for this gentleman , what does it need ?
What can you do ? Can you do it ?
Well , can you sell it ? Can you search for money ? ''
`` Oh , no , I ca n't do that . '' `` I want you to look for somebody ? ''
We activate communities .
Thank you .
Those of us around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives .
We do n't know all the neighbors , so we do n't change a lot of knowledge despite the same public spaces .
In the last few years , I 've been trying to share with my neighbors in the public space , with simple tools like <unk> , and as simple tools like <unk> and templates and chalk .
These projects were born of questions like , how much do I pay my neighbors for their apartments ?
How can we be paying and borrowed <unk> and borrowed the door at a bad moment ?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better our landscape ?
How do you share more of our empty stores of empty shops so that our communities can reflect our needs today and dreams ?
I live in New Orleans , and I 'm in love with New Orleans .
My soul would always find relief with <unk> , <unk> lovers and <unk> <unk> for centuries and I trust a city for centuries and I trust a city .
That every day sink in music , there 's a parade in New Orleans , the city 's most beautiful architectures , but also one with the most beautiful amount of abandoned properties .
I live near this house and I thought about how it could turn it into the enjoyable space for the neighborhood , and also something that changed my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost someone who loved .
It was Joan , as a mother for me .
His death was sudden and unexpected .
I thought a lot about death .
And this was a profound gratitude about time .
It made clarity about the significant things of my life today .
But I 'm going to take care of my daily life .
It seems like it 's easy to get them out and forget the very important thing to do for you .
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall out of this house on a giant blackboard , he painted on a giant blackboard and painted on it , `` Before I want to die I do ... ''
So , prisoners could take up and reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space .
I did n't know what to expect from this experiment , but the next day , the next day , was filled with and still <unk> .
And I 'd like to share some of the things that people wrote on the wall .
`` Before I want to die , I want to be court 's court . '' `` Before I want to die , I want to sit on the date line . ''
`` Before you die , I want to sing for millions of people . ''
`` Before I could die , I would plant a tree . ''
`` Before you die , I want to live outside the network . ''
`` Before I ever have died again . ''
`` Before you die , I want to go to someone . ''
`` Before you die , I want to be completely myself . ''
This abandoned space that became constructive and dreams and hope of people made me laugh , they made me laugh , I 'm going to get out of it , and I 'm getting comfort me in the tough times .
It 's about to know that you 're not alone . It 's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and new and <unk> . It 's about supporting reflection , and to remember what 's most important for us as we grow and change .
This happened last year , and I started getting hundreds of messages of people who wanted to make a wall in their community in their community .
And so with my colleagues at the center of the civic center , we made a kit , and now , in the countries , like , the countries , like Kazakhstan , Australia , like Kazakhstan , Australia , and beyond .
And together we proved the power of public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other .
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people .
In our age of distractions growing , it 's more important than ever , and find the ways to keep track and remember that life is brief and delicate .
Now , death is something that we often avoid talk about , or even think of , but I understood , but I understood that for death for death , it 's one of those things that we have more power .
If you think about death , it 's our life .
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope , fears and stories , and the other stories around us can not only help , and fears and stories .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I 've got a single request today .
Please do n't tell me that I 'm normal .
Now I 'd like to introduce my siblings to my brothers .
<unk> is 22 and very hot .
It does n't talk , but it 's about better joy than some of the best speakers .
<unk> knows what love is .
It turns out what happens .
It 's not <unk> . It does n't look like skin color .
You do n't care religious differences , and notice this : never lied .
When I 'm singing our childhood songs , trying to tell the words that I do n't even know I could remember , it reminds me of one thing : how little thing we know about the mind is : how little is the wonderful thing that we know about mind .
Samuel 's is 16 . It 's high .
He has the most pristine memory .
However , it 's a selective memory .
It does n't remember , it 's me stolen , but it reminds me of this year , but it remembers the year 's songs of my iPod , conversations that we had when I was four years old , to pee on my arm , in the first episode of <unk> and Lady 's birthday .
Does n't seem amazing ?
But most people do n't agree .
And in fact , because your minds do n't fit the concept of normal society , they are often ignored and <unk> .
But what that propelled my heart , and I get my soul was that even if that was the case , although that was the case , although it would not consider them in the ordinary ordinary , it could only mean that they were extraordinary -- that were just a thing : they were extraordinary -- they could just mean , they were extraordinary ...
Now , for those less familiar with the term autism , it 's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
And in each individual manifests itself in a different way , it 's going to be so different from Sam .
And all over the world , every 20 minutes is diagnosed with autism , and even though it 's one of the development disorders that 's going to get faster in the world , there is no cause to be known .
I do not remember my first encounter with autism , but I do n't remember one day without him .
I had only three years when my brother came to the world , and I was very excited about having a new self to be in my life .
When a few months a few months , I realized that he was different .
It was a lot .
I did n't want to play like the other babies , and in fact , it did n't seem like very interested in me at all .
I was living in and wrapped up in his own world , with his own rules , and I found pleasure in the smallest things , like putting cars around the room around the room , looking at the car around the room , looking at the washing machine around the room .
As I grew up , it got more different , and the differences became more evident .
But beyond the <unk> , the frustration and the endless hyperactivity , there was something really unique : an pure , pure nature , a child that saw the world without biases , a human being that never lied .
<unk> .
I ca n't deny that there have been some tough times in my family , moments where I have wanted them to be just like me .
But I look back at the things that you have taught me about individuality , and communication and love , and I realize that they 're things that would not want to change by normal .
normality , normality 's very high the beauty that gives us differences and the fact that it 's wrong .
It just means there 's a different view of what 's right .
If I could reach a single thing , and I could see Sam and to you , and you would , it would be not normal to be normal .
They can be extraordinary .
Because autistic , autistic , the differences we have -- They 're a gift ! Each one of us has a gift inside , and honestly , the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
The opportunity for greatness , the progress and change dies in the time when we 're trying to be like each other .
Please do n't tell me that I 'm normal .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I experienced a little bit about what should have been going to be Alice in the 1992 country .
Penn State asked me , a communications teacher , who was a communications teacher who gave me a engineering class students .
I was scared . I was really afraid of these students with their great minds with their great minds with their great minds , their big books , and their big books and their big , unknown words .
But when those conversations developed , I felt what Alice must have felt when he fell through the rabbit dog and saw the door of a new world 's hole .
Just like , I felt when I had those conversations with students , and I was surprised with the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience , also , and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world .
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication .
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers with the end of changing world .
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our greatest challenges , from energy to environment , among others , and if we do n't know that we do n't know about this , work is not done , and I think it 's not done , and I think it 's our responsibility for scientists to have these interactions .
But these great conversations ca n't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world .
So scientists and engineers , please get <unk> .
I want to share some suggestions about how can you do that to make sure you can make sure that you can see their science is sexy and sexy .
First question for us : and then what ?
Let 's tell why science is relevant to us .
Do n't tell us , they just study <unk> , they are studying the <unk> , who are the mesh structure of our bones , because it 's important to understand and treat osteoporosis .
And when you 're describing your science , careful with the jargon .
The jargon is an obstacle to our understanding of ideas .
Sure , you can say `` spatial and time , '' but why do n't you say `` space and time , '' which is much more accessible to us ?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as stupid .
Instead , as Einstein said , it 's all as simple as possible , but not simple .
They can really communicate their science without compromise with ideas .
Something to consider it is to be able to use examples , stories and analogies , they 're ways of turning it up with their content .
And by presenting their work , forget about the bullet signs .
Have you 've been wondering why are they called the bullets `` bullets ? What do the bullets do ? The bullets kill them , the bullets kill , and they 'll be killed , and they 'll kill your presentation .
A <unk> like this is not just boring , but it 's supporting too much in the language of the language of our brain and we 're overwhelmed by .
Instead , of <unk> Brown , it 's much more effective , it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design for the only design for the only design of Eiffel Tower .
The trick here is to use a simple , legible phrase , that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit , and then then provide graphs that will make our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what is being described .
I think these are just a few key key to that that they can help everyone else open the door , and look at the country of wonders that 's science and engineering .
And so , scientists and engineers , when you 've solved this equation , because of all the media , <unk> with <unk> . Thank you .
One of my favorite favorite favorite words of all the Oxford English Dictionary is `` <unk> . ''
Just because it sounds very good .
And `` <unk> '' means `` dishonest policy . ''
Although there was a Latin publisher of the 19th century that it was defined by a lot better when he said , `` A <unk> is that you 're looking for a public charge , no matter whether , platform , or start it by the mere use of a monumental <unk> monumental . ''
I have no idea about what it means `` <unk> . ''
Something to do with words , I guess .
It 's very important that words are the basis of politics , which all politicians know they have to try to dominate language .
It was n't until , for example , I 'd argue that the British Parliament allowed the newspaper to quote up to the exact exact words they were saying in the parliamentary camera .
And this was all about the courage of a guy named <unk> <unk> , who faced with Parliament .
He brought him in the Tower of London , and he was incarcerated , but he had the little courage to face them , and in the end he had was such popular support in London that won .
And just a few years later , we had the first use of the <unk> sentence of the phrase `` that <unk> <unk> . ''
Most people think it 's literal .
It 's not . It 's about a freedom advocate .
But to show you really how words and politics interact , I want you to go back to America , just after independence .
So , they had to address the question of how he 'll call George Washington , his leader .
They did n't know .
How do you call the the leader of a Republican country ?
This was debated in Congress for a long time .
They were presented all kinds of suggestions that they could have <unk> .
Some people wanted to call it `` Chief Washington , '' and others , `` Her George George Washington , '' and others , `` <unk> George Washington <unk> , Washington . ''
Not very attractive .
Some of them just wanted to call him `` King . ''
They thought it was really , they thought .
And not even with it , they were <unk> , they had the idea that you could be chosen by King for a given run .
And I could have served .
Everybody has tired tired , because this debate <unk> over three weeks .
I read the diary of a poor Senator , and I always write , `` still with this issue . ''
And what caused the delay , and <unk> was the House of Representatives was against the House .
The House of Representatives did n't want Washington to be empowered .
They did not want to call him King calling him by his successor to him or his successor .
So , they wanted to give him the most insignificant , and they wanted more insignificant and more unfortunate than they did .
And that title was `` President . ''
President . They did n't invent the title already existed before , but it only meant , but it just meant `` someone to do a meeting . ''
It was like the president of a jury .
And I did n't have much more nuanced than the term `` foreman , '' or `` supervisor 's supervisor . ''
There were young presidents who had small presidents and the government fractions , but it was really a insignificant title .
And that 's why the Senate is about .
They said , `` That 's ridiculous , we ca n't call President . ''
`` This guy has to sign treaties and meet with foreign <unk> . ''
`` And who 's going to be serious with a kind of ridiculous title and a kind of ridiculous title like President of America ? ''
And finally , after three weeks of debate , the Senate did not win .
We can learn three interesting things about this .
First of all , and this is my favorite way to where I 've been able to figure out , the Senate has never been influenced by the rule of President .
President Barack Obama is very lucky to continue there , waiting for the Senate in action .
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says , a government 's time , it 's possible that we 're going to move forward for <unk> years .
But the third thing that we can learn , and this is the most important thing , and I want to leave you with , is that the President of President of America does n't sound so modest today , right ?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads at disposal , the largest economy in the world and a fleet of <unk> <unk> and so on .
Reality and history have endowed the <unk> title .
So at the end of the end , the Senate .
They got his title of <unk> .
And also the other concern of the Senate -- well the appearance of uniqueness -- well , it was a singularity .
But , you know how many nations have now ?
And all because they want to sound like the guy and 5,000 nuclear warheads , etc .
So , at the end of the Senate , and the House won , and the House of Representatives lost , because no one is going to be humble now .
And I think that 's the great lesson that we can learn , and that I 'd like to leave you with .
Politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality , but actually , it actually changed a lot more words than they could actually change reality .
Thank you very much .
I 'm 45 feet underground in an illegal mine from Ghana .
The air is loaded and the dust , and it 's hard to breathe .
I feel the touch of bodies in <unk> , but I ca n't see much more .
I hear that they talk to you , but above all , that cacophony of this cacophony of male male and stones , I hear with primitive tools .
Like everybody else , wearing a cheap flashlight from <unk> tied to the head with this <unk> , and I can barely distinguish the branches of the <unk> , and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that one meter of a meter , which is a hundred meters of meters on Earth .
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a miner . I met days before , who lost the control , and she fell a hundred meters on that pump just a hundred meters in that well .
As I talk to you today , these men , these men are in the deep hand of that hole , not paying their lives without pay , and often dying .
I went home , and I went home , but they might never do it , because they are prey in slavery .
In the last 28 years , I was documenting native cultures over 70 countries , and in 2009 , and in 2009 , I had the great honor at the end of the Vancouver Peace section Summit .
Among all the incredible amazing people I met there I met there I met in an integral <unk> , a NGOs that was involved in modern slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and really , really , started to learn about slavery , because I knew that there knew that there was in the world , but not just such a degree .
When we finished talking to me , I was honestly wrong ; I was honest , I was honest , I was not sure how many people do n't know ?
He got a knot knot and weeks later , I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> . ' '' And I offer her help .
So it started my journey to modern slavery .
Interestingly enough , I 've been in many of these sites .
Some , I thought , even as I considered them .
But this time , you 'd find the dirty dirty time .
A conservative calculus is now over 27 million people now have over 27 million people in the world .
It 's twice as much as much of displaced Africans 's total .
150 years ago , the cost of a farmer farmer was about three times the average wage was about three times the U.S. 's spending .
The equivalent of about $ 50,000 today .
However , today , you can empower entire families for dollars for debt for $ 18 .
Remarkably , slavery generates over $ 13,000 millions per year worldwide .
Many have been fooled with false promises of good education and better work to find out that they are forced to work without pay , under threat to violence , they can not escape .
Today slavery operates in trade : the goods produced by slaves , but those who produce disposable ones are disposable .
slavery exists almost worldwide , and yet it 's illegal all over the world .
In India and Nepal and I met the building furnaces .
This weird , weird show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the Dante .
<unk> at a temperature 54 , men , women , children , in fact , entire families , in fact , entire families wrapped up in a heavy forest of mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically stack up bricks in their heads that are going to be at hundreds of meters .
<unk> the monotony and tiredness are working in silence , doing this task over and over for 16 17 hours a day .
There was no breaks to eat , nor to drink , and the severe <unk> would make you pee pretty inconsequential .
So <unk> were the heat and the powder that my camera got too hot , to touch and stopped working .
Every 20 minutes , I had to run away the car to clean the team and get it to work on air conditioning and just sitting there , thinking , my camera gets a much better treatment , a lot better than these people .
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry , I wanted to cry , but the <unk> I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said , `` Lisa , do n't do it . Do n't do it here . ''
And he explained to me very clearly , emotions is very dangerous in places like this , not just for me , but for them .
I could n't offer you any direct help .
I could n't give you any money , nothing .
I was n't the citizen of that country .
I could put them in a worse situation where they were already .
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> , and working within the system for their release and trusted , trusted about it .
As soon as me , I waited to get home to get my own smashed heart . ''
In the Himalayas , I found kids carrying rocks for rocks for mountain land to trucks that they were hoping below .
Those big little bit had stronger than the kids who were charge and the kids who hold them hold their heads made off their heads made out of sticks , which and rags and rags .
It 's hard to witness something so overwhelming .
How can we influence something so insidious but so on ?
Some of you do n't even know that they 're slaves -- 16 17 hours per day -- because this has been like this all life .
They do n't have anything to compare .
When these villagers were <unk> , the <unk> they burned their homes .
When you hear the word slavery so often we think about sexual traffic , and because of this world awareness would warned me that it would be hard for me working with security in this particular business .
In Kathmandu , <unk> women had been previously previously seen .
I took a set of stairs stairs which were going to give up this dirty basement of <unk> light <unk> .
It was n't exactly a brothel .
It was a restaurant .
<unk> , as you know in the craft , they are local for forced prostitution .
They have small rooms , private rooms , where slaves with their girls with their girls and children , some of the only seven -- they 're forced to entertain customers and <unk> and buy more food and alcohol .
Each post is dark and dirty , identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain .
The workers often suffer with sexual abuse of clients .
On the dusk of dusk , I remember having sense a fear of <unk> , and then I could barely imagine what it must be being stuck in hell .
I just had a exit : the stairs where I entered .
There was no gates .
There was no windows as to climb as they climb .
Those people do n't have <unk> and , because we 're playing a topic that hard , it 's important to point out that slavery , including the sex , even sexual disease .
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture , in restaurants , home service , and the list can continue .
Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slaves as a sex .
It 's everywhere , but we do n't see it .
And textiles are another activity that often relate to slave labor .
I went to Indian villages in which there were whole families <unk> in the trade of silk .
This is a family portrait .
The <unk> hands of black are the father of blue , blue , <unk> , from their children .
<unk> <unk> on these large barrels and <unk> silk , the silk fluid , up to the <unk> , which is toxic .
My performer told me about stories .
`` We do n't have freedom , '' they said .
`` We still expect , yet , be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our work . ''
It 's estimated that there are over 4,000 are enslaved in the <unk> lake , the largest artificial lake in the world .
When we got , I 'm going to get a quick look at quick .
I saw what seemed like being a family of a ship , two older brothers , some younger kids , some younger children , makes sense ?
Wrong . They were all slaves .
Kids are separated from their families sold , they were missing and forced vehicles to work <unk> <unk> in these boats in the lake , even though they 're not able to swim .
This boy is eight years old .
When our boat approached it was shaking , it was that his little canoe .
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling water .
The <unk> trees are located in the trees in freezing lake by often trap and children , <unk> and fear , and they 're afraid , they 're getting the water to unleash the branches .
Many are drowned .
Since remember , it has always been forced to work on the lake .
By fear of his love is not going to run away , and like all of life has been treated , and like all of the life has been treated with cruelty , <unk> .
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning , when you were the last little networks , but they 'd been working on from the one one morning , but they had been working from the one morning .
At night , cold night .
And it can point out that these nets weigh over 400 pounds when they 're packed with fish .
I want to introduce us to Kofi Annan .
Kofi Annan was rescued in a fishing village .
I met him in a hut that I met the <unk> <unk> of slavery .
Kofi Annan symbolizes it .
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life ?
He went through a road in Ghana in Ghana with <unk> partners , a mate with a mate with his motorcycle and <unk> , and <unk> up our car and played the window .
It asked us to spread it through a path to the forest .
At the end of the way , we were going to get out of the car , and asked the driver to go out of it quickly .
And then he pointed this very barely visible path and said , `` This is the road , this is the road . Come . ''
As we started to go down , we took the <unk> , we took the <unk> on the way and after walking around an hour , what the path was going to find was that the way I was going to have the photos of my head on the chest .
After two hours of walking , the <unk> path ended up abruptly in a clear field , and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit in a football field , and they were all full of <unk> workers .
A lot of women had children had children with their backs walked up on the side of them and they were looking for gold , walked around with mercury .
The mercury is used in the process of extraction .
These miners are enslaved in a pump in another part of Ghana .
When they came out of the pump , they were <unk> in their own sweat .
I remember looking tired eyes tired , given , given that many had been underground for 72 hours for hours .
The pits are up to 90 feet and these people are carrying heavy bags of stone bags that will then be transported back to another area where they 're going to rock the stone .
You know , the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> , but if you look closer you , I see a little less fortunate to work out at the other least as well as children .
They 're all victims of injuries , diseases and violence .
In fact , it 's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this one victim of tuberculosis and the pipeline were very likely to end up in a few years .
This is <unk> . When his uncle died , he took him to work with him in the mines .
By dying his uncle , he <unk> , <unk> the debt of uncle in mines .
When I met him , I had worked in the 14 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the mine , so severe that doctors said it should be true .
In addition to that , <unk> has tuberculosis , and yet , it 's forced to work night and day in that mine .
Yet , he 's dream of being liberated and educated with local activists from local activists like <unk> the <unk> .
I want to throw light out of slavery .
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world .
I wanted to know that we knew that we 'll be going to be able testimony to help change their lives .
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings , then it 's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
These images are not from magazines . It 's from people , real people , real people like you and like me , who deserve the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
There is n't one day that I think about these so many beautiful people , battered , that I 've had the great honor of meeting .
I hope that these images will wake up a force in those who you see them , in people like you , and I hope that that force turns a fire to fire and that fire out of the light of slavery can continue living on the shadows .
Thank you very much .
I make applied mathematics , and there 's a peculiar problem for anyone who does , we are like management consultants .
Nobody knows what the hell we do .
So today , I 'm going to try and tell you what I do .
Dance is one of the most human .
We <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk> that we 're going to see later .
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training , a high-level level of skill , and probably a initial top-down thing can have a genetic component .
Unfortunately , neurological disorders like Parkinson 's disease , constantly destroy this extraordinary ability , as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who , in his age , was a virtuous dancer .
In the last few years , a lot has been made in the treatment .
However , there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick and they have to deal with an incurable struggle , tremor and stiffness and other symptoms of this disease , and so we need objective tools of this disease , so we need objective tools before it 's too late .
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way , and ultimately , the only way we will know if there is really a cure for us to know if there is really a cure for us to know if there is really a cure .
But it 's frustrating that for Parkinson 's and other disorders , and other disorders of movement , and so do n't work blood analysis and the best thing we have , is a neurological test for 20 minutes .
You need to go to a clinic . It 's very , very expensive , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , they never do .
And what if patients could do it at home ?
That would save a journey to the clinic , the clinic would be able to do the test themselves ?
You do n't need personal .
By the way , it costs about $ 300 in the neurological clinic costs .
So , what I want to propose as not as conventional , to try , you see , in a sense , at least , we 're all <unk> , like , you know , in a sense at least , we 're all <unk> .
This is a video of the vibration the vocal chords .
It shows somebody healthy as sounds as sounds sound to speak , and we can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet , because we have to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds , and we all have the genes needed . <unk> , for example .
And , like ballet , it requires an extraordinary training level .
Let 's think time that he takes a child learning to talk .
From sound , we can track the position of the vocal strings as vibrate , and as Parkinson 's disease , it also affects the vocal organs .
And on the bottom , you can see a <unk> example of the vocal cords of the vocal cords .
We see the same symptoms .
vocal shake , weakness and weakness .
The discourse becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while , and this is an example of symptoms .
How do you compare these tests based on the specialized clinical trials with specialized clinical trials with specialized clinical trials ?
The neurological testing is not non-invasive .
We do n't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them .
Both of these are skillful . OK , but also , the tests on the voice are n't specialized .
I mean , they can be <unk> .
They do very quickly , they take about 30 seconds as a lot .
They 're at minimum cost .
When something takes a cost : it appears on mass mass .
These are some incredible smart goals to address .
We can reduce the patient 's difficulties .
I would n't need to go to the clinic for <unk> <unk> .
By monitoring how we could often get high monitoring data .
We could do a massive <unk> <unk> to clinical trials , for clinical trials , for clinical trials , and for the first time we could do , we could be able to overall scale .
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first biomarkers of the disease before it is too late .
So by giving today the first steps in that sense , we 're launching the <unk> Initiative .
Along with <unk> and <unk> , we want to register a lot of a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals .
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world .
Anyone , with or without Parkinson 's , can call back a low price , and I 'm going to find recordings for pennies , and I 'm pleased to announce that we 've got to announce that we have reached six percent .
Thank you . Tom Rielly : So Max , taking all these samples out of , say 10,000 people , say , 10,000 people , you 're going to say who you 're healthy , who are you going to say who you 're healthy and who ?
What will you bring from these samples ?
Max Little : Yeah , yeah , what happens is that you have to tell if you 've got it or not the disease -- TR : `` You have it or not the disease . TR : Okay .
<unk> : You see , some people do n't have to pass . You may not end up .
But we 're going to get a very big sample of data set up in different circumstances , and it 's important to do that in different circumstances , because we 're looking for <unk> factors for the actual markers of the disease .
TR : Do you have 86 percent accuracy at this time ?
<unk> : much more than that .
In reality , my graduate student , <unk> , have made a fantastic job , and now it 's shown that it works on a mobile phone phone network as well , what we 're going to do the project , now we have a 99 percent accuracy .
TR : Ninety and nine . Well , it 's an improvement .
<unk> : Of course .
TR : Thank you very much . Max <unk> , public , public .
<unk> : Thank you , Tom .
Before March March 2011 , he was making <unk> <unk> in New York City .
We 're <unk> creatures , gray .
We 're focusing on the dark rooms , in no windows and , typically avoid sunlight .
We make the <unk> models even thinner , the perfect skin even more , we do the impossible , and we 're going to make it in the press all the time , but some of us really criticize the press all the time , but some of us really got a lot of talent with a lot of experience and a true taste of images .
On March 11 of March in 2011 , I saw from my house as the rest of the world , the tragic events going to Japan .
Shortly after , an organization where it was a volunteer -- there <unk> <unk> , it was in the place working as part of the answer team .
I , along with hundreds of other volunteers of other volunteers , we knew that we could be sitting in a house , so I decided to join the group for three weeks .
On May I traveled to <unk> .
It 's a little <unk> of located in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people , one of the first 50,000 people affected by the wave .
The water level water level over 24 feet , more than three kilometers , in the ground .
As you can imagine , the people was crushed .
We got rubble from the canals and ditches .
<unk> schools . We took the slime , we leave the lists to be <unk> and <unk> .
We took tons and tons of dead fish , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> from the local factory .
We got ourselves and loved it .
For weeks , both volunteers and neighbors found things like that .
They found pictures and pictures of cameras and cameras and cards faster .
Everybody did the same thing .
<unk> them and bring them to different places of the villages of all around to <unk> .
It was n't until then I realized that those pictures represented by a huge part of the personal loss that that people have suffered .
While he was fleeing the wave , and to save their lives , they had to abandon absolutely everything they had .
At the end of my first week , I started to help in a center of the village .
It helped clean the bathrooms the big big , huge , huge <unk> .
This place turned out to be also the place in the town where the building blocks pick up the photos .
There they were and had the honor that she would have the honor of me that day to wipe out the photos .
This was exciting and inspiring , I 'd heard the expression to think beyond the horizons , but it was n't going to go through my horizons .
When you look at the pictures , I found some that they were more than a hundred years of still in the lab were still in the lab , and I could n't help but think about how to fix how to fix how to fix that same thing as to fix that same thing .
So that night , I went to Facebook and I came up with some of them , and the next morning , the answer was so overwhelming and positive , that was so overwhelming and , I knew that the next morning we had to try .
So we started to play with the photos .
This was the first one .
It was n't too spoiled , but where the water had stepped up the face of the girl had very precision and it 's about it .
In another way , that little girl would n't look like it 's like it , and that would be as tragic as he was having the inspiration photo .
At the time time , they came up with more pictures , and they got more understood , and they took it out more LinkedIn , this was that she went back on Facebook and LinkedIn , and five days of 12 countries were offered to help .
Within two weeks , it was 150 <unk> of joining with .
In Japan , in July , we mobilized in Japan , a village in North Japan .
Once on the week , we use our scanner in the temporary photographic libraries that have been installed , where people were going to reclaim their photos .
The time you would take it in <unk> is a different story depended on the photos of the photos .
I could support an hour . I could entail weeks .
It could entail months .
This <unk> had to draw by by hand , using the areas which color and detail that the color and the detail had not destroyed it .
It took a long time for it .
The water destroyed all these pictures submerged in saltwater , covered with algae , with algae , even with algae , even with algae , even with oil , and it 's all over the time , I continue to continue continue on the time , so you 're going , I 'm carrying continue by hand it up with a major part of the project .
We ca n't get a dispute about the photo unless it was clean , dry and have been beaten by their owner .
We were lucky enough to hand .
We have the surgeon of a remarkable neighbor neighbor .
It 's very easy to harm even more than the photos .
As once again , the leader of my group is like a tattoo .
You ca n't make mistakes .
The woman brought up with these photos were kind of like the photos .
He had started to <unk> her herself but stopped realizing that even more .
I had also had <unk> .
Without them , the images of her husband and his own face would n't have been able to rebuild , we were able to turn the images into a single picture and pull the whole picture .
When he picked up his pictures shared something about his story with us .
A few colleagues from her husband found photos in a fire station in the rubble far away from where he used to be his house , but their colleagues recognized it .
The day of the tsunami , his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers .
He had to go inside the water while <unk> .
Their children , small kids , not so small , but their two children were at school in schools in different schools .
One of them was stuck in the water .
He took a week to find all his family and knowing that everybody had survived .
The day I gave him his youngest son at age 14 14 years .
For her , despite all of this , photos were the best gift that I could do , something that he could remember , something that he could remember from the past that day that would n't have been beaten by that March , when everything in his life changed , and he was destroyed .
After six months of six months in Japan had joined by <unk> hundreds of them , they helped us to clean up hand by hand , the vast majority came back in their own <unk> , <unk> .
More than 500 volunteers of all the world helped us back 90 families , hundreds of photos of totally <unk> and <unk> photos .
During this time , we really do n't spend more than $ 1,000 in teams and materials , most ink for printers .
We take pictures of the time .
A picture of someone or something , a relationship , one relationship , loved one of a relationship , a relationship , loved one of a particular relationship .
They 're <unk> of our memories and stories , the last thing that we would be looking for .
This was about the project , to restore little little pieces of humanity , to give someone the connection to the past .
When a picture like this comes back to someone , it 's a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it .
This project also made a big difference in the <unk> life .
Some of them connected with something bigger , using something , using talent to something that they do n't have , using talent for something that they do n't have thin skin models with perfect skin .
So , I 'd end up like reading this electronic email , I came back Cindy day the day I came back from Japan after six months .
While <unk> , I could n't avoid thinking about the people and stories shown in the images .
One in particular , a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the young girl , gathered me around a baby , I was moved , because a similar picture of my family my grandmother , my mother , my mother , my daughter , newborn , hangs on our wall .
In the entire world , in the entire world , in every single number , is the same , right ?
Thank you .
Doc lent to us , curiosity , curiosity with this picture of a bullet going through an apple , in an exhibition for a millionth of an apple , a millionth of just a millionth of it , a millionth of all the second .
But now 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and look at the world not a million or a billion , a billion frames per second per second , but to a trillion frames per second per second .
I present to you a new kind of photograph of it -- a new technique that can make you make a slow motion videos of the light motion video .
And with that we can create cameras that you can see behind the corners , beyond the line of vision line , or see inside the body without using X-rays , and they challenge really the whole idea of the camera without X-rays , really defy the idea of the camera .
If I take a laser pointer , and I turn it into it and put it into a second <unk> , it 's a <unk> photons to create a package of just a millimeter of photons from just a millimeter wide photons to just create a package of a laser from just a millimeter wide simply a millimeter .
And that package of photons , that bullet , traveling at the speed of light , and again , a million times faster than a common bullet .
So if we take that bullet and this package of photons and fire in this bottle , how do those photons disperse inside this bottle ?
What is the slow motion of light ?
Now , all of this -- remember that all of all happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to take light .
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light in motion .
Coca-Cola is n't this research . It 's a lot of things that are in this movie , and we 're able to show this information to show what 's going on .
The pulse , our bullet will come into the bottle with a packet of <unk> photons that starts to <unk> , and inside it start to <unk> .
Part of the light gets away , goes to the table , and we start seeing these ripples .
Many of the photons will finally come to the cap and explode in various directions .
As you can see , there 's a bubble of air that bounces off inside .
In that time , the waves travel around the table and because of the top thoughts you can see at the bottom of the bottle , after several frames , that are concentrate .
Now , if we take a common and the current and the current and we make it run the same distance , and we see it in slow motion and we see it 's about 10 billion times , how much do you think it would take us to see that movie ?
A day ? One week -- actually a year .
It would be a very boring film of a slow film on movement .
And what about <unk> of dead nature ?
You can see the waves coming down from the table , the tomato paste and the wall on the wall .
It 's like throwing a rock into a pond .
It 's the way that nature looks a picture , I thought , from a <unk> at the time , but of course , our eyes see a comprehensive composition .
But if you look at a more time <unk> , you 'll realize that , as the light goes over of the tomato tomato , bright . It 's not <unk> .
Why ? Because tomato is ripe and the light bounces back into the inside and it comes back and forth .
In the future , when it 's going to be on your cell phone , you 're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without having to touch it .
What do we make this camera at MIT ?
So , like photographers , you know , take a picture at low exposure , it comes very little light .
But we 're going a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition , so I 'll just get a little bit of light .
We sent that bullet , that package of photons and millions of times , and we recorded again and again , and we recorded it again and again with very , very , very early sync with it to create those <unk> .
We can take all of those raw data data in an interesting way .
Superman can fly .
Other heroes can become invisible .
And if a new power of a superhero would allow you to see after the corners ?
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door . <unk> , you go into the room , one part is going to reflect on your door , and you 're going to reflect the camera , and you 're going to get it into the camera . ''
Where we could extract those multiple bounces of light .
It 's not science fiction . We 've already done it .
On the left , there 's our <unk> .
Behind the wall in the wall , and they <unk> the light on the door .
After the publication of nature of our article in Nature .
And a small fraction of photons will go back to the camera , but interestingly , slightly different times .
And as we have a camera that works like this quickly , our <unk> , has unique capabilities .
It has very good temporary resolution , and you can look at the world at the speed of light .
So , we know the distances to the door , and also the hidden objects we do , but we do n't know what point in .
As a laser , you can record a laser record , that you see on the screen , it really does n't make any sense .
But we will take a lot of images like this , dozens of images , we 're going and try and analyze the multiple bounces of light , and that 's what we 're going to try and analyze the various light bounces ?
Can we see it in 3D ?
This is our rebuilding .
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab , but in the future , we could create cars that can avoid collisions of what 's going to go around the curve .
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected in the open windows .
Or we could build a <unk> , able to look inside the body 's body through <unk> , and the same thing .
But of course because of the tissue and the blood that 's pretty hard , so this is really hard for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new model of visualizing the <unk> as a kind of new model of visualizing the problems .
So , like Doc <unk> , himself , a scientist , I became art , an art of photographs of photographs .
I realized that all of the data of data that we find it out and not just scientific gigabytes of the data that we have , but we can be able to figure out .
So creating a new form of computational photography , it 's <unk> motion and color .
And look at those waves . Remember , time between each of those waves is just a couple of second <unk> .
But here also something fun .
If we look at the waves underneath the cap , they go away from us .
The waves waves should move towards us .
What happens here ?
It turns out , as we 're recording almost at the speed of light , we have strange effects -- Einstein would have to look at this image .
The order of that occur in the world at time events , sometimes it 's invested in the camera .
We made the corresponding warping of space and time , we can correct this distortion .
It 's time . Thank you .
Hi . This is my mobile phone .
A mobile phone can change life , and individual freedom .
With mobile cell phone , a mobile crime of humanity in Syria .
With cell phone , you can tweet a message in Egypt through a cell phone .
With a cell phone record , you can record a song , move it famous .
This is all possible with a mobile phone .
I 'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in Berlin the city of Berlin .
Let 's go back to this town .
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were protesting in the pursuit of change .
This is the fall of 1989 , and imagine if all of these people gathered , they put a phone change , they had a cell phone .
Who should have a mobile phone here ?
<unk> .
Raise your mobile phone , <unk> !
<unk> . An Android , a Blackberry , wow !
It 's very much . Almost everyone today have a cell phone .
But today , of my mobile phone , and what changed life .
I 'll talk about this .
These are 35 <unk> lines .
Data : raw data .
Why is that information there ?
Because in the summer of 2006 , the E.U . I presented to you .
The <unk> of data .
This directive says that every European phone company , every Internet provider , has to store a broad range of information from users .
Who calls who you . Who 's sending an email from who you .
Who sends a text to who you .
And if we use the mobile phone , where we are .
All of this information is stored for at least six months , and even two years , in their telephone company , or for two years of the Internet .
And all in Europe , people stood up and said , `` We do n't want this . ''
They said they did n't want this retrieval retention .
We want to be self-determination in the digital age , and we do n't want to get the phone phone and Internet providers all this information about us .
There were lawyers , journalists , priests , everyone said , `` We do n't want this . ''
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out on the street in Berlin and said , `` Freedom , fear , fear . ''
And some of them even said that this would be the <unk> 2.0 .
The <unk> was the secret Eastern Germany .
And I also asked if this works really works .
Can you can store all this information about us ?
Any time use mobile ?
So I asked my phone , <unk> <unk> , which then was the largest telephone company in Germany , which is please <unk> me all the information they had about me .
I asked them once , and I did n't get them back , and I did n't get a concrete answer . It was all blah blah blah .
But then I said , I want to have this information because you 're having my life out .
So I decided to give you a judicial demand because I wanted to have this information .
But <unk> <unk> said no , we 're not going to give this information .
At the end end , a agreement .
And they would give me the demand and they would send me the information I would ask .
Meanwhile , the German <unk> Court : the German <unk> Court did the <unk> law of the E.U .
So I got this ugly one in brown with a CD inside .
And on the CD there .
Thirty and five thousand <unk> within information lines .
At first I saw them , and I said , `` Well , it 's a huge archive . OK .
But after a while , I realize that 's my life .
There are six months of my life in this archive .
It was a bit skeptical : what should I do with that ?
Because you can see where I am , where I 'm at night , what I 'm doing .
But then I said , I want this thing to go out .
I want to make it public .
Because I want to show people what the retention of data does .
So , along with <unk> Online , we did this .
This is a visualization of six months of my life .
You can get closer and pull out , go backwards and go back .
You can see every step I give .
And you can see what I 'm going to be able to go from the train to Cologne , and what I often call in the journey .
This is all possible with this information .
That gives a bit of fear .
But it 's not just about me .
It 's all of us .
First , there are things like , I call my wife and she calls me , talk a couple of times .
Then they call me some friends and they call me some friends .
And then you call the other <unk> , and then you end up with this great communication network .
You see , you can see how your people communicate in each hour what time you call each other than time to sleep .
You can see this all .
You can see the centers , the leaders of the group .
If you have access to this information , you can see what society is doing .
If you have access to this information , you can control your society .
This is a model for countries like China and Iran .
This is a model to study the shape of your society , because you know who you 're talking with , who sends an email to who , who gives you an email to who , who gives you an email to who , who gives you an email to who , who gives you an email to who , who gives you an email to you who , who
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe , and even two years .
As I said at the beginning , imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin , in the fall of 1989 , they had a cellphone .
And the <unk> had known who was in this protest , and if he had known , who was in this protest , and if he had known , who was the leaders , this would never have occurred .
The fall of the Berlin Wall of Berlin never happened .
And , as a consequence , it 's not the fall of it for the <unk> .
Because today , state agencies , and business agencies , and companies want to store the data from us as it 's possible in the web .
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and want to store them forever .
But self-determination and living in the digital age is not a contradiction .
But today you have to fight for self-determination .
You have to fight for that every day .
When you go back home tell your friends , it 's a 21st-century value of 21st century , which is not in fashion .
When you go home , tell your representative your representative , because businesses and state agencies can store some information , do n't have to be able to do it .
And if you do n't believe me , ask your phone company , what some of them store from you .
So in the future , every time you can remember your cell phone that helps you to remember that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age .
Thank you .
Hi TEDWomen , what happens ?
It 's not enough .
Hi TEDWomen , what happens ?
I call myself <unk> and I 'm not <unk> , but I know the doctor that brought me the world .
Let me go back to my mom six different times in six different different directions , and they 're <unk> to the poor of me in the process .
As a result , I have cerebral palsy , so I 'm going through it all the time .
Look .
It 's exhausting .
And Muhammad Al .
No C. No genetics .
It 's not <unk> and contract .
No one was <unk> the uterus of my mother and not my parents because my parents were cousins , siblings , even though they are .
It just happens for accidents , like the one that happened at birth .
Now , I warn you , I 'm not a source of inspiration .
It feels bad for me , because at some point of life , you wish .
Go walk .
Christmas <unk> , they 're in the mall , they 're going in the mall , and they drive in and , what do you see ?
I was 16 empty places for disabled .
And they 're like , `` God , God can be at least a little disabled ? ''
Also , I tell you , I have a 99 problem , and the P. C. '' is just one of them .
There was a <unk> of oppression , and I would win the gold medal .
I 'm Palestinian , I 'm Muslim , I 'm Muslim , and I live in New Jersey .
If you do n't feel better , maybe you should do it .
I 'm in <unk> Park , in New Jersey .
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had to have the same early ones .
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City , I could have . ''
A lot of people with cerebral palsy do not walk , but my parents do n't believe in the `` ca n't be . ''
My father 's mantra of my father was , `` You can dance to <unk> <unk> . ''
If my three older sisters , I cleaned .
If my three older sisters went to public school , my parents went to public school , my parents would run out of the school , <unk> me , and if we did n't take all the maximum note note , we all took to my mother 's mother .
My father taught me to walk at the five years , putting my feet on her feet and just walking .
Another tactical one I used to use a dollar come in front of me so that it 's going to be <unk> .
The <unk> I carry on was very strong and ...
Yeah . The first day in kindergarten was walking like a boxing champion who has received a boxing champion .
Growing up , there were only six Arabs in my city , and were all of the family .
Now there are 20 Arabs , and they 're still all the family . I think no one realized we were not Italian .
This was before 9/11 , and the politicians would think appropriate to use `` hate hate , '' as slogan .
The people I grew up with no problem with my faith .
But yet , it seemed like a lot of hunger coming out of hunger during the <unk> .
I would tell them that I had enough fat enough to live three months without eating before , so much like sunrise , to dusk it is very easy .
I danced with Broadway .
Yes , on Broadway . It 's crazy . My parents could not afford physical therapy , so they sent out a dance to dance school .
I learned to dance with a heels or I 've learned to be a heels .
I 'm from New Jersey , and there we want to be <unk> , so if my friends are using heels , I 'm also in a heels too .
And when my friends were going to spend summer holidays , I was n't going .
I spent my summers in a war zone , because my parents were afraid if I do n't go back to Palestine all the summers , all summers , if you do n't go back on Madonna . ''
On the summer vacations , a summer often my father was about <unk> , so I would drink milk milk , put me dead cups on my back , and I remember <unk> on the Dead Sea , and I remember the water Sea <unk> . ''
But the miracle cure was yoga .
I have to say that it 's very boring , but before doing yoga was a comedian 's comedian that could not stand up .
And now I can stand on my head .
My parents would have this idea that I could do anything , that no dream was impossible , and my dream was impossible , and my dream was to be at General Hospital .
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the <unk> , University of State University , University of Arizona , because it came in all the <unk> .
It was like the mascot pet 's <unk> .
Everybody loved me .
I did all the least smart tasks , I took the maximum note on my classes , and also I was in their classes .
Every time I did a scene from the crystal zoo my glass zoo zoo .
But I never got a role .
Finally , in my last year , the <unk> decided to make a work called a slow dance dance on Jackson .
It 's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy .
I was a girl with cerebral palsy .
So I started screaming at four winds , `` Finally , I 'll have a paper !
I have cerebral palsy !
At the end ! Please free free .
Thank God mighty , finally I 'm free . ''
I did n't get the paper . They gave it to <unk> Brown .
I went to <unk> running at the director of the theater , tears , historically , as if someone had killed my cat and ask me why , and she said to me , because they thought I could n't have killed my cat stunts .
And I said , `` Excuse me , if I ca n't do the risk stunts , you can not have the character . ''
It was a role that I had literally been born and gave an actress without cerebral palsy .
The university was imitating my life .
Hollywood has a history of <unk> actors without disability to disability .
By graduation , I went back home , and my first <unk> tour was , was like extra on a soap basis .
My dream was true .
And I knew it would be <unk> from `` companion friend crazy <unk> in <unk> . ''
Instead , I was there like a vase like a vase , and it did n't look more than the back of it , and it was obvious to me that the deal directors , we do n't know , <unk> actors .
You just accept perfect people .
But there were exceptions to rule .
I grew up looking at <unk> Goldberg : <unk> <unk> , and these women had one thing in common : they were comedians .
So I made it <unk> .
In my first tour he took famous comic comics from New Jersey to New Jersey , and I 'll never forget the face of the first comedy was that he took when he fell at the end of the New Jersey freeway with a driver of cerebral palsy .
I worked in clubs across the United States , and also in Arabic in the Middle East , without censorship and without veil .
Some people say I 'm the first <unk> of the Arab world .
I never like to reclaim the first one , but I know you never heard that little nasty nasty little <unk> that says that women are not fun , and you find them very fun .
In 2003 , my brother of another mother and father , Dean <unk> , and I was launched the New York City Festival of New York City , now in his <unk> year .
Our goal our goal was to change the negative image of the media and at the media , and at the time directors of <unk> that are <unk> and Arabic is not synonymous .
It was really much easier to fight Arabic was a lot easier to fight the challenge of disability .
My great opportunity came in 2010 .
I was like invited on the news news program , with Keith <unk> .
I went into a graduation like I went to a graduate study to a study and sat me down on a wheelchair .
I looked at the principal , and I said , `` Excuse me , can you give me a chair ? ''
She looked at me and said , `` Five , four , three , three ... ''
And we were live .
So I held up to the desk of presenter to get out of the screen during the segment , and when I finished the interview , I was blood blood .
I had my opportunity and I had my opportunity and I knew you would n't have having me .
But not just Mr. <unk> went back back to inviting me , but I was like a full-time participant and pasted my chair . ''
Something else I 've learned directly from Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are scum .
You know , kids are cruel , but you have never heard of myself or older .
Suddenly , my Internet disability became fun .
I would see clips clips , and `` Why <unk> ? ''
`` Is it <unk> ? ''
And my favorite thing : `` Poor <unk> .
What disease has ?
We really should pray for her . ''
One reviewer suggested even my disability to I would add my rsum , writer , comedian .
Disability is as visual as race .
If someone in a wheelchair ca n't do <unk> , then you ca n't do <unk> , then you know .
The disabled are the -- yeah , clap , man . Come on .
The disabled are the largest minority of the world , and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment .
Doctors said not walk , but I 'm here in front of you .
However , having grown up with media , but I do n't think it was .
I hope that together we can create the most positive images of disability in media and everyday lives .
Perhaps if there were more positive images , that I 'll make less hatred of the Internet .
Or maybe not .
We may still need all of society to teach our kids .
My tortuous journey has led me to very spectacular places .
I came to <unk> by the red carpet by Susan <unk> soap : and the famous <unk> <unk> .
I got to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my hero , the amazing Dave Matthews .
You know , <unk> the world is running crazy .
I was <unk> in the great state of New Jersey state in 2008 in 2008 .
And I founded `` <unk> Children , '' a charity , to give children refugees , a tiny little bit of my parents .
It was the only time my father saw to act alive , and I read this talk to his memory .
lie on peace , dad .
I call myself <unk> <unk> , and if I can , you can too .
I 'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a small village .
I do n't know their name , but their story .
She lives in a small South town of <unk> .
This people are near <unk> .
<unk> drives the small people to poverty and the edge of starvation .
Without anything for him there , it goes to the great city , in this case , <unk> , Somalia , Somalia , Somalia .
When it comes there , there 's no opportunity , no work , no job perspectives , no job perspectives .
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk> .
After maybe a year <unk> , nothing .
One day you 'd get a guy on lunch , then you give it to lunch , to eat breakfast .
He knows a dynamic group of people , which gives you a break .
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes , money to send home , his family .
He 's presented to a young man .
Finally was home .
It starts starts with a new life .
It has a mission of life .
A beautiful day in <unk> , under a blue sky sky bursts .
That child of that little boy with the dreams of the great city , was a suicide bomber , and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> , a terrorist organization organization connected to al Qaeda .
So how about the history of a little boy in a little town trying to get his dreams in the city end with with him <unk> ?
He was waiting for .
I was waiting for a chance to start their future , waiting a future perspective , and this was the first thing he came up with .
This was the first thing that he did , `` the waiting period . ''
And his story repeats in urban centers around the world .
It 's the history of the marginalized , the story of the marginalized urban , that <unk> riots in Johannesburg , which are looking at something beyond the waiting period .
For the young people , the promise of the city , the great dream of the city , is the opportunity , of jobs , of jobs , well-being , young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities .
Often it 's the youth that suffers from the highest unemployment .
By 2030 , three of every five people who live in cities are going to be under age of 18 .
If we do n't take the young people in the cities , if we do n't take opportunities , the story of the source of the waiting period , and the door of access to terrorism , to be the history of the cities .
And in my city of birth , <unk> , 70 percent of young people are unemployed .
70 percent does n't work , it 's not going to school .
They do nothing pretty much .
I went back to <unk> last month , and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital , where I was born .
I remember looking at that hospital , I 'm going to say , `` And if I would never have gone ?
And if I would have been forced to be in that same same kind of waiting time ? ''
Would he have become terrorist ?
I 'm not really sure about the answer .
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to house some juvenile leaders at a corporate pinnacle .
And we will find out about 90 youth leaders .
We sat down and we had a brainstorming about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city .
One of the young people in the room was <unk> .
He was at the University of <unk> , graduated .
There was no work , no opportunity .
I remember when he told me , because he was a graduate university , unemployed , frustrated , was the perfect white white for al Shabaab and other terrorists , to be recruited .
They were looking for people like him .
But this story takes a different way .
In <unk> , the biggest obstacle to reach A B is the streets .
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the road , and a motorcycle could be the easiest way to mobilize .
He saw an opportunity and <unk> .
He started a motorcycle .
It started on <unk> out to the local people who normally , who they typically could not drink .
I bought 10 motorcycles , with the help of his family and friends , and his dream is at some point , expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years .
Why is it different from this history ?
What makes this story different ?
I think your ability to identify and take a new opportunity .
It 's the business spirit , and I believe that the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the waiting period . ''
<unk> young people will be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so desperately .
And you can train young people to become entrepreneurs .
I want to tell you about a young man who went to one of my meetings , Mohamed <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
I was helping me to train some of the young people in the business of entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship .
In fact , it 's the first <unk> who has seen over 22 years , and until Mohamed got , until Mohamed came , if you wanted flowers for your wedding , you wanted flowers for your wedding .
If you would tell someone , `` When was the last time you saw fresh flowers fresh ? ''
For those who grew up during the civil war , the answer would be `` never . ''
So , Mohamed saw a chance .
He started a company <unk> and floral design company .
I created a farm outside of <unk> , and he started to grow <unk> <unk> and <unk> , who said , they could survive the hard weather on the <unk> weather .
And he started the delivery of flowers for weddings , building gardens in the city , and now he 's working in the creation of the first public park public park of <unk> in 22 years .
There are no public parks in <unk> .
He wants to create a space where families , young people , can go together , and as he says , smell the pink pink <unk> .
By the way , he 's not pink because they use a lot of water .
So the first step is to inspire the young people , and in that room , the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the young people .
They had never thought about starting a business .
They had thought about working for an NGO , to work for the government , but their story , and their story , really had a strong impact on them .
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities .
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be <unk> .
By the end of the day , they already had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city .
They 're <unk> solutions for local problems .
So , inspire young people and creating a business of entrepreneurship is really large step , but young people need capital capital to make their ideas .
They need experience and guidance orientation for them in development , and they need their businesses .
They encourage young people with the resources they need to deal with the support they need to move from conception to creation , and create catalysts for urban growth .
For me , the entrepreneurship is more than starting a business .
It 's creating a social impact .
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
I think it 's selling hope .
His Peace Park : this is how it calls it , when it 's created , it will transform the way people see their city .
I hired kids from the street to help rent a little bit on the street to help you rent the bikes kids out .
They gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the `` waiting period . ''
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities .
So my suggestion is : become young people in entrepreneurs , <unk> and eating their inherent innovation , and they 'll have more stories about flowers and more stories of the Peace of the <unk> .
Thank you .
I was about 10 years old , and I went camping with my dad in the <unk> mountains in the <unk> mountains in New York City .
It was a beautiful day .
The forest <unk> .
The sun was made up that leaves like a <unk> , and it 's not the way that we could still pretend that , we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land .
We arrived at our camp .
It was a shed of an shed with sight of a beautiful lake when I discovered something horrible .
Behind the shed was just a dump one of four square meters with rotten aluminum <unk> and aluminum paper balls , aluminum selfish .
And I was amazed , I was very angry and very confused .
<unk> them that were too lazy as to pull out what they were thinking about , who they thought was going to do , who they thought was going to clean up their garbage ?
And that question went on on with me , and it was a little bit .
Who cleans our garbage ?
No matter how to organize or where do you put our `` our own '' in Istanbul ?
Who cleans our trash into Rio or in Paris or London ?
Here in New York City , the Department of <unk> cleans our trash , which is about 11 tons of waste and 1,000 tons of recyclable products .
I wanted to know as individuals .
I wanted to understand who that work does .
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that load ?
So I started a research project with them .
I traveled on the trucks and walked through his tracks and interviewed people in offices and <unk> people in the entire city , and I learned a lot , but it was still a little bit , but it was still a <unk> .
I needed more .
So , I began to work like <unk> of crap .
Now I just did n't just travel in the trucks . I do the players .
And they operated the mechanical mechanical mechanics in the snow .
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning .
Everybody asked about smell .
It 's there , but it 's not as mainstream as you believe , and in the days that it 's very strong you .
It costs a lot to get used to weight .
I met people who had been working on it for several years , and their bodies were tracking their bodies to weight on their tons of garbage every weeks .
It 's also the danger .
According to the Bureau , according to the Bureau of <unk> , the garbage collection , one of the most dangerous breeding Bureau of country , and I learned the collection reason .
You 're coming out in the traffic all day , and it 's moving around you .
They just want <unk> , so usually the driver is not paying attention .
That 's very bad for the worker .
And also the trash itself , it 's full of dangers who often fall out of the truck and terrible damage .
I also learned about the relentless of crap .
When you get out of the <unk> , and you see a city from the back of the back of the truck of the truck , you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature itself .
Stop coming .
It 's also like a kind of breathing or circulation .
It always must be movement .
And the stigma is also .
I think stigma is particularly ironic , because I think strongly that I think a lot of waste is the most important workforce in the streets of town , for three reasons .
It 's the first protecting of public health .
If you do n't get rid of the waste in efficient , efficient and effective every day , this starts to <unk> from its container and its dangers inherent , they would threaten us in very real ways .
Disease that we had for for decades and centuries come back to sprout , and they start <unk> .
The economics needs it .
If we ca n't get rid of the old thing , we have no space for the new motors that begin to fail when it 's in danger of consumption .
I 'm not advocating for capitalism , but I 'm just pointing out of capitalism .
And then there 's what I call our daily <unk> necessary .
So , I 'm just talking to the speed that we used to move used on contemporary times .
We usually do n't worry , or very early , clean , or we take our coffee cup of coffee , our <unk> bag , our water bottle .
We use them , we throw them , we 're forget about them , because we know that there 's a job force on the other side to commission from it .
So today , I want to suggest a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city .
Her work , I think , almost <unk> .
They 're on the street every day , <unk> .
They use a uniform in many cities .
You know when you 're going .
And their work allows us to do our own .
They 're almost a way of relief .
The flow that we keep keeping us in safe from ourselves , from our own waste , our waste , and that flow has always to stay in one way or another .
One day after September 11th , 2001 , I heard the grunt of a garbage collection truck on the street , he grabbed my little son up the stairs , and I went down the stairs , and there was a man doing his journey out of recycled paper like it was doing all on Wednesday .
And I tried to thank her for the job that day , in particular , but I began to cry .
And he looked at me and he just looked like , and he said , `` We 're going to be okay .
Let 's be okay . ''
Shortly after that , I started looking at the waste collection , and I went back to that man .
It 's called <unk> , we work together many times , and we did good friends .
I want to believe that <unk> was right .
Let 's be okay .
But in our efforts to rebuild the way that we exist on this planet as a species we need to include and have to account for all the costs , even the cost of very real human cost .
The city waste , which we think when we 're talking about trash , represent three percent of the nation 's waste 's waste .
It 's a remarkable thing .
So in the flow of your day and your lives , the next you see someone whose job is to clean the crap from you , take a moment to acknowledge them .
Take a moment for saying , thank you .
My work focuses on connection to thinking about our community life is a part of the environment , where architecture is naturally traditions and traditions and traditions .
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this .
Both of these projects are located in emerging countries , one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia .
They also share the fact that different analysis had from different perspectives to become an essential part of architecture work .
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall for several stories in the capital of Ethiopia , Addis Ababa .
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example , my team and me , about what we had to design .
At first , the first thing I thought was , `` I want to run out . ''
After seeing some of these buildings , there are many in the city , we realize that there are three important aspects to point out there .
In principle , these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores because they have very large stores that people can not afford to buy stuff .
Secondly , you need to spend a lot of energy because that 's the <unk> skin <unk> heat inside , so it takes a lot of cooling .
In a city , it should n't happen because it 's about a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees for 25 to 25 degrees throughout the year .
And third , what you look like is nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia .
It 's a pity for a place that 's so rich in culture and traditions .
In our first visit to Ethiopia , I was really hooked up with the ancient market that is this structure outdoors where thousands of people go and buy things every day to small marketers .
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity .
So I thought , that was what I really wanted to design , not a mall .
But the question was how we build a modern building , a few stories , applying these principles .
The next challenge was presented to the building site , which is located in a lot of a lot of growth in the city , where much of the buildings that we now see in the image , did n't exist .
And it 's also between two parallel streets that they do n't communicate in a hundred yards .
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets , putting together all the inputs of the building .
And this spreads to an inclined atrium that creates a space outdoors in the building itself , by its own way , the Sun and rain atrium .
And around this space we have applied the market with small businesses , that changes in each floor because of space .
I also thought , how do you close the building ?
I wanted to find a solution to local climate conditions .
And I started thinking about a similar tissue <unk> concrete shell of the air to allow the air for air , but in a form of light , but a way filtered out .
And then we inspired these beautiful buttons in the Minister of the Ethiopians , the dresses of the Ethiopians .
They have properties of this fractal geometry , and it helped me to model the facade .
So we 're building that with these little top-down pieces that are the windows that let them move the air and light it in a controlled way inside of the building .
This is <unk> with these little colors that they use the light crystals of the inner light crystals of the building light in the night .
With these ideas , it was n't easy to convince developers because they thought , `` That 's not a commercial mall . '' It was n't what we ask . ''
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be a lot more profitable to than the mall in the mall will sell .
And also the idea of the facade was a lot more economic , not just because of the material compared to the glass , but also because it was no longer needed to have air conditioning .
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project we use .
The first thing was to think about how to make the energy energy for the building energy in a city , the power of electricity in every day .
So we got a big advantage by putting up on the roof .
And then under those panels , we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of gathering and bars that create urban oasis .
And these are <unk> on the roof , which together , we collect water for water .
They 're waiting for the next year , because we 're going for the fifth floor of the construction floor .
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia .
And to perform a project so big , the biggest that I 've been designed , I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia , it needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia .
During that analysis , I got special attention in the <unk> , a thousand years earlier , was surrounded by a wall with twelve <unk> connected from the lines in almost straight access to lines .
When I went to the first design operation , the first design operation that we did , it 's going to expand 12 blocks that were similar in size and features that we have in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these courtyards .
In addition to that , we select some strategic dots in relation to the idea of the interconnected gates with straight lines , and this shifted the initial model .
And the last operation was to think about the cell , the small cell , like the apartment , as an essential part of the master plan .
I thought , what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate ?
And it 's straightforward , because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation .
So it 's a scheme that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction .
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block , and the Arab city .
It has these blocks with courtyards , and then at the lower plant , we have all the connections for pedestrians .
And it also responds to local norms that they can make greater density at the upper levels and a lower density plant to the ground .
And it also reinforces this idea of doors .
The roof , which is my favorite favorite space of the project is almost like to give the community occupied space for construction .
It 's where all the neighbors , you can go up and socialize , like doing such as a race race to run in the morning , or you 're going to jump from a building to the other .
These two examples , they have a common approach to design process .
And also , they are in emerging countries , where you can see the cities literally growing up .
In these cities , the impact of the architecture in the lives of people changes communities and local economies to the same pace that the buildings grow .
For this reason , even more important , I see even more important to look at the architecture looking simple , affordable solutions that are improving the relationship between people and the environment .
Thank you very much .
When I was eight years old , a new girl went to our class . It was so remarkable , as you see all the new girls .
I had a very bright little hair of pencils and a little <unk> of pencils , cute . It was super strong for capitals of the state capitals , very good for <unk> .
I finished that year , and I was filled with jealousy until I was able to let my sinister plan .
I was a time after a day out of school , and it was a bit late late , I hid in the girls ' toilet .
When the coast was <unk> , I went out in the classroom , I came in the classroom , I came up with my master 's degree of grades .
And then I did .
I would get the grades of my rival grades just a little bit .
All right . And I set up the book , and I set up the book , but some of my other partners had very good grades too good .
So , in a frenzy , you 'll get the notes around the world , without any imagination .
I put up every few rows and myself and myself kind of a row of myself , just by being there , because he could ...
I 'm still amazed at what I did .
I do n't understand how the idea arose was .
I do n't understand why I felt right .
I felt important .
I do n't understand why I never got caught up .
It was all obvious .
They never found me .
But especially , I would tell me the reason why I bother this little little girl , so small , was so good for <unk> .
<unk> jealousy .
They 're so mysterious and so forth .
We know that babies suffer of jealousy .
Also primates . Birds are very likely .
We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spouses in the U.S .
And yet , I 've never seen a study from looking at loneliness , or the long duration or the sadness .
So , you have to go to the fiction -- because the novels are like the lab that they study jealousy , jealousy way of how many possible shapes .
In fact , I do n't know if it 's an exaggeration to say that if you have jealousy , <unk> would have no literature .
Well there would be aware of the <unk> , there would be `` Odyssey . ''
There would be no king jealous , no king , <unk> .
There would be Shakespeare .
He 's going to be aware of high school lists for high school , because we would lose `` The Noise and <unk> , '' `` `` Party '' to `` Party <unk> '' and `` Party us . '' We 'll be to `` Madame <unk> '' and `` Party <unk> K . ''
No jealousy , no Proust . I know it 's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers for everything , and in terms of jealousy , it 's all .
This year , 100 years of his masterpiece , `` Look for the lost time , '' the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy , the most exhaustive study of sex , and also , in Proust 's details , right ?
We think in a child trying to reconcile the dream .
We think about a <unk> <unk> in tea .
We forgot how hard that image is .
We forget about the relentless that it is .
I mean , it 's the books that , Virginia <unk> said were as hard to cat <unk> .
I do n't know what the cat <unk> is , but we assume that it 's <unk> .
Let 's see why they 're going so well together , the novel and jealousy , jealousy way together , jealousy , jealousy , jealousy .
It will be very obvious , like jealousy , like jealousy , the person who are reduced to the person , are a solid <unk> narrative ?
I do n't know . I think we got very close out of bone , when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy .
When we feel jealousy , we tell ourselves a story .
A story about life of other people , and those stories make us terrible , because they 're designed for that , to make us feel bad .
Now , at the time storytellers , I know exactly what the details were to include , to nail the knife , right ?
jealousy do we all have the jealousy , jealousy , that 's something that Proust understood .
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give it to another , maybe right now . ''
And it starts to say himself that story , and since then , Proust says that every fresh charm you can detect detect at , it adds to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private chamber .
You have to admit that <unk> and Proust were notoriously jealous .
You know , Mount Proust would have you to abandon the country , if you wanted to break up with him .
But you do n't have to be so jealous to recognize that it 's hard work . Right ?
jealousy are <unk> .
It 's a hungry emotion . You have that feeding .
And how are the jealousy ?
The jealousy jealousy guess .
The jealousy , jealousy detail .
jealousy , jealousy , jealousy , bright hair and cute little <unk> of pencils .
The jealousy wonder of the photos .
And that 's why , Instagram is so successful , Proust links , good language <unk> with jealousy .
When <unk> is in their own jealousy , he 's suddenly listening to the gates and <unk> of his lover , who are so <unk> .
He says , `` Look , I know that you think this is disgusting , but it 's not different from the interpretation of an old text of an old text or looking at a memorial . ''
He says , `` These are scientific research with real value of intellectual value . ''
Proust is trying to prove that jealousy and jealousy , you 're trying to show us that jealousy , search of knowledge , search of knowledge , search of knowledge , to search of the truth , to search of the truth , to search of the truth , to search of the truth , the more painful .
Pain , humiliation , loss : These were the path towards Proust 's wisdom .
He says , `` A woman who we need , who makes us suffer , causes us a much more profound range , and vital that a wise man who can be interested in that . ''
Is it telling us that we 're going to look for women is cruel ?
No . I think it 's trying to say that jealousy , jealousy .
And is there any other excitement that we can open ourselves up this particular way ?
Is there any other excitement reveals us , is our aggression ambition and our rights ambition ?
Do you have any other emotion that teaches us how to look in such peculiar intensity ?
Freud 'd write about this later on .
One day , Freud was visited by a very nervous young guy who was being consumed with the idea that her wife was <unk> .
And Freud says there was something weird about that , that he did n't know what his wife did .
Well she was innocent . Everybody knew it .
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause .
But he was looking for things that his wife did , without realizing behaviors .
Do you know too much ? Or accidentally you get a man ?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife of his wife .
novels are very good at this .
novels described very well , how jealousy how jealousy do you think about , but not precision .
In fact , the more intensely , the more we are , the more we become the fantasy .
And for this reason , I think , jealousy , jealousy , mundane acts of us doing violent acts .
jealousy drive us to behave <unk> ways .
Now I 'm thinking about the age of eight , eight years , I recognize it . But I 'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news .
A woman of Michigan for 52 years of age , was captured by having created a fake fake account for Facebook , from which they were sending <unk> , horrible himself , for a year .
For one year , a year .
She was trying to send me back to the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend , I have to confess that when or this , I reacted to admiration with admiration .
Because , let 's be realistic .
How big , although unfortunate , creativity . Right ?
It 's like a novel novel .
Just like a novel <unk> novel as well .
<unk> is one of my favorites .
She is a very strange and bright guy from American literature .
It 's the author of `` <unk> in a <unk> , '' and `` Mr. <unk> <unk> , '' books that try out how the jealousy minds , and once we 're in the sphere , the jealousy , the jealousy , the jealousy realm that separates what might be like , can be unambiguous .
Take Tom <unk> , his most famous character .
So Tom <unk> is going from <unk> or wanting what you 've got to do with you , and you would be <unk> from what you 've ever got , and you 're under the floor . <unk> your name . <unk> your bank accounts .
It 's a way .
But what do we do ? We ca n't take the road <unk> .
I ca n't give you <unk> everybody , as long as I sometimes want to .
It 's a pity , because we live in envy .
We live in the time of jealousy .
I mean , are we good citizens of social networks , where the currency is envy ? Right ?
Did the novels show us ? I 'm not sure .
So we 're going to do what characters always do when they 're not sure , when they 're in the mystery .
Let 's go off the Baker Street and ask by Sherlock Sherlock Street .
When people think about Holmes , thinking about the curse curse in Professor Moriarty , that criminal genius .
But I have always favorite <unk> , the head of <unk> Scotland , <unk> , I need , desperately , he needs the rider genius , she needs the rider genius , but he 's annoyed him .
Oh , I 'm so familiar with you ...
<unk> needs your help , but <unk> with bitterness in each of the mysteries .
But as they work together , something starts to change , and finally at the <unk> of the Six <unk> , once she walked into , <unk> with everyone with his solution , <unk> back to midnight and he says , `` We 're not so far , Mr. erection .
We 're proud of you . ''
And he says that there 's not a person in Scotland who do n't want to <unk> her hand .
It 's one of the few times , and it 's one of the few times , and I think it 's very emotional . That 's this scene too emotional . Right ?
It seems to treat jealousy as an geometry of geometry .
You know , in a minute rushed from the opposite side of <unk> .
The next minute is the same thing .
All of a sudden , <unk> are allowed to admire that idea of being <unk> .
Could it be so simple ?
What if jealousy ? jealousy geometry , just a question of geometry , just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other ?
Well , maybe we do n't have to forget about the other people 's excellence .
We can <unk> it .
But I like contingency plans .
So as we expect that that happen to happen , let 's remember that we have the fiction to come out .
It 's only fiction only fiction .
I used them , alone , invites them to the table .
And look what it takes : the sweet <unk> , the terrifying terrifying terrifying terrifying -- the Marcel <unk> , the Marcel Proust itself .
We 're in great company .
Thank you .
We used to solve big problems .
The July 21 of July 21 , Buzz Aldrin jumped out from the Apollo Sea module and landed on the <unk> Sea .
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone alone , but their presence in the gray surface gray -- was the culmination of a bottom-up collective process .
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization for peace in history in American history .
To get to the moon , NASA 's spent about 180 billion dollars today from a federal day , four dollars of the federal budget .
The Apollo gave about 400,000 people work about a dozen people and asked 20,000 companies , universities and government agencies .
People were killed , including the crew of Apollo 1 1 .
But before the Apollo program <unk> <unk> , 24 men went on the moon .
Twelve walked on on its surface , which Aldrin pointed out after death from Armstrong from Armstrong from Armstrong , is now the oldest man .
So why were it ?
They did n't get a lot of around : 100 pounds of old rocks , and something that 24 hundred will do later , a new sense of the sheer sense of the lottery and the fragility of our common home .
Why were it ? The cynical response is that they were because the Kennedy 's president , was to demonstrate the Soviets had better rockets .
But the words of Kennedy at Rice University in Rice University in 1962 give us a better idea .
John F. Kennedy F. The <unk> ?
Why does it turn it into our goal ?
And you might also ask , why do you scale the highest mountain ?
Two years ago , why is flying on the Atlantic ?
Why does Rice play with Texas ?
We choose to go to the moon .
We choose to go to the moon .
We choose to go to the moon in this decade , and do other things , not because simple , but because they 're hard .
Jason <unk> : The Apollo man was not just a single victory of the West on the Cold War .
At the time , the stronger emotion was the realization to the transcendence of technology .
It was because it was a great thing to do .
The landing on the Moon , in a context of a long list of technological humidity .
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line , and the plane , penicillin , the penicillin for the road .
In the middle of the century , <unk> polio , and removed smallpox was removed .
The technology seemed to own what it was called <unk> in 1970 , called `` strength <unk> . ''
For most of the history of humanity , we could not go faster than a horse , or a ship boat , but in 1969 , the Apollo crew was 10 , the <unk> flew at 40,000 miles away .
Since 1970 , no human being has gone to the moon .
Nobody has traveled faster than the Apollo crew was 10 , and the optimism of the optimism about the power of technology has evaporated when we think that 's going to be a clean energy , cure cancer , you seem to have a clean energy , cure cancer , you seem to have a <unk> .
I remember looking at the Apollo age leave 17 .
I was five years old , and my mother told me not to look at the <unk> escape from the rocket <unk> of the rocket Saturn .
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission , but I was completely sure that I would see the colonies on Mars .
So that `` something happened to our capacity for solving problems with technology , '' has become a common place .
We heard that all the time .
We heard over the last two days here at TED .
It seems like the technologists , and they were enriched with trivial toys , things like trivial , things like iPhones and applications and social networks , or algorithms that speed the automated selling .
There 's nothing wrong with most of these things .
They 've expanded and enriched our lives .
But they do n't solve the big problems of humanity .
What happened ?
There 's a parish explanation in Silicon Valley , which <unk> have less ambitious companies that have been created less ambitious companies that are <unk> .
Silicon Valley is that markets are the guilty , in concrete , the incentives that we risk capitalists offer them .
Silicon Valley is the risk of risk caused by the creation of incremental ideas worth of incremental , or even a false problems .
But I do n't think this explanation is good enough .
It 's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley .
Even when the venture capitalists were at risk were at their peak without worrying about risk , they preferred small investments , so they could go out in 10 years .
<unk> . They 've always had trouble investing with benefit in technology as energy as energy , that they need an enormous capital and whose long-term development , and not have invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems , because they do n't have a commercial value value .
No , the reasons we ca n't solve big problems are more complicated and profound and profound .
Sometimes , we 're choosing the big problems .
We could go to Mars if we want to .
NASA has even designed a plan .
But going to Mars would require a political decision that are popular , and that 's never going to happen .
We do n't go to Mars because everybody thinks there 's more important things to do on Earth .
Sometimes we ca n't solve the big problems , because the political systems fail .
Today , less than two percent of global energy consumption is from sources of renewable energy sources like solar , wind and <unk> . Less than two percent , and the reason is completely economic .
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind is cheaper than the solar power and wind is cheaper than the <unk> .
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete at the price . There are no .
Now , technologists , entrepreneurs and economists agree what policies and treaties international treaties the development of alternative energy : mostly a significant increase in research and development of energy , and some kind of price control development and energy development .
But there is no hope in the political climate is today that we 're going to see an energy energy policy American <unk> that reflects that consensus .
Sometimes , the big problems that looked at the technological , do n't be .
We know for the time that hunger is a result of failure in the food allocation .
But 30 years of research studies have taught us that hunger are political crises that affect <unk> the food distribution .
Technology can make better things like crops or systems for storage and food system , but there will be hunger as bad governments .
Finally , big problems are going to make a solution because we do n't understand the problem really .
The President Nixon was declared war in 1971 , but soon we find out that there are many types of cancer , some <unk> of treatment , and only in the last 10 years , they seem to find effective and viable and viable treatments .
<unk> problems are hard .
It 's not true that we can not solve the problems with technology .
We can , and we should , but these four elements have to be here : the political leaders and the population have to want to solve the problem , the institutions must be able to address the problem , the institutions must be able to support the solution , that 's really a technological problem , and we need to understand it .
The Apollo mission , which has become something like a metaphor for the capability of technology to solve big problems , it does it with these criteria .
But it 's a <unk> model in the future .
We 're not in 1961 .
There is no competition , like in the Cold War , there is no politician like John , and dangerous , and dangerous , and there 's no popular mythology .
In general , going out to the moon , it turns out to be simple .
It was just three days .
And really , it was n't even in address any problem .
We 're alone in our present , and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get .
God knows that the challenges are missing .
Thank you very much .
Well , I 'm going to talk about trust , and I 'm going to start with the widespread ideas that you have about trust .
They 're so common that they 've become <unk> from our society .
I think they 're three .
The first one is a claim : there has been a major decline of trust , is a very widespread belief .
The second is a goal : we should have more confidence .
And the third is a task : we should recover the confidence .
I think the claim that the claim , the goal and the task , the task , the goal , I think .
What I 'm going to try to tell you , today is a different story about claim , a goal and a task , which I think gives you a more clear idea about it .
First of all claim , why do people think that trust has come down ?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence , I do n't know the answer .
I bow to thinking that it may have fallen in some activities or institutions and institutions that could have increased each other .
I do n't know .
But I can turn to the opinion polls , and the polls are supposed to be the source of belief , the source polls has declined .
When you look at the polls of opinion polls , there 's not a lot of evidence of it .
I mean , the people who were <unk> 20 years ago , mainly journalists and politicians , are still inspiring the same thing .
And the people who were very trustworthy about 20 years ago are still pretty reliable : judges , nurses .
The rest of us in the middle , and by the way , the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way .
But is this evidence enough ?
What the records of opinion polls are recorded , of course , opinions .
What else can you do ?
What you see are the generic attitudes that people when they 're doing certain questions .
Put ourselves in the politicians ? Are you hurt ?
Now , if someone asked you , `` Are you <unk> ? ''
Are you going to run away from the fishermen ?
Do you invest in primary school ? ''
They 'd probably say , `` To do what ? ''
And that would be a very sane response .
And you could say , when you 've answered your question , `` Well , I trust some of you , but you do n't . ''
It 's very rational .
Ultimately , in real life , we tend to place trust a separate way .
We do n't assume that the trust level we 're going to feel by a kind of a given official , <unk> officer is going to be uniform in all cases .
I could , for example , say I trust a certain degree of elementary school I know that I 'm going to give the book , but in no way to drive the school <unk> .
After all , I could know that was n't a good driver .
I could trust my most talkative , you might have a conversation , but not maybe , to keep a secret .
Simple .
And if we 've obtained those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is separate , why we stop side all of that knowledge in more abstract form ?
I think surveys are very bad tools for measuring the real confidence level of real trust , because they 're trying to perform the inherent judgment in the fact of something or in someone .
Secondly , what about the goal ?
The goal is to be more confident .
Frankly , frankly , I think it 's stupid .
It 's not that the goal that I 'm <unk> .
I would be able to have more confidence in what 's <unk> , but not what it is .
Ultimately , I am keen to do what you 're not trustworthy .
And I think that the people who were saving their savings with very rightly called Mr. Madoff , who then disappeared with them , I think , and I think , well , they were too confident .
Being more confident is not an intelligent goal in this life .
He deposited or bioenergy with intelligence , that is the right target .
Once you say it , yeah , yes , it means , it means that what matters first is not the trust , it means trustworthiness .
What it 's about is to do a judgment on how people are in certain ways .
And I think that in order to be able to make a trial , we 're forced to focus on three things .
Are they competent ? They are honest ?
And if we find that one person is competent , and it 's accountable and honest , then we 'll have a very good reason to trust it in it , because it 's going to be worthy of trust .
But if , on the contrary , they 're not responsible , we could trust them .
I have friends who are competent and honest , but I do n't trust them to take a letter to the mail , because they 're <unk> .
I 've got friends who are very sure that they can do certain things , but I see that they 're your own skills .
And I 'm glad to say that I do n't think I have a lot of friends that are competent and responsible , but extremely <unk> .
If I did n't realize it .
But that 's what we 're looking for : trustworthiness .
The trust is the answer .
The trustworthiness is what we need to judge .
And , of course , it 's hard .
In the last few decades , we 've tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions , professionals , professionals , and people , and make them easier , and made us easier for them to judge their trustworthiness .
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect .
They do n't work as they should .
I remember once I was talking with a <unk> , and he said , `` Well , you 'll see the problem is it takes more time to make the civic paperwork that attend to the delivery . ''
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives , institutional and institutional , that the accountability system is destined to guarantee the trustworthiness .
What they do is difficult to get the work of people who have to do hard work , like the midwives , like the midwives , which we say , `` <unk> <unk> , '' as we say .
I 'm sure all of you like that .
All of all , for the goal .
I believe that the goal should be more trustworthiness , and that things would be different if they will be worthy of trust , and we will tell people that we are trustworthy , officials would be worthy of confidence , and they 're going to determine whether other people , officials are worthy of trust .
It 's not easy . It 's judgment , simple , simple actions .
Third , the task .
They put the task to rebuild the task , to put the confidence back in .
It suggests that you should be able to rebuild the confidence .
Well , we can do it ourselves .
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness .
We can do it if they 're two people , together , trying to improve trust .
But trust , ultimately , is distinctive , because you give it a few other people .
You ca n't rebuild what other people have given you .
You 've got to give them the foundation enough so that you can trust yourself .
You have to be worthy of trust .
And that , of course , because you can not trick , usually all people , all the time .
But you also have to contribute evidence that you 're worthy of trust .
How do you do that ?
That 's a daily basis , everywhere , it makes the ordinary people , the officials , very effectively .
I 'll give you a simple example .
The store where I bought my socks , he says I can bring them back and give them explanations .
I carry them back and give me the money , and they change it for the color that I want .
That 's great . I trust in them because they became vulnerable to me .
I think there 's a great lesson about that .
If you come back vulnerable to the other part , that 's a good test that you 're worthy of trust , and you have trust in what you 're saying .
So at the end of it , I think what we 're aiming for is not very difficult to figure out .
What people trust is in relationships , and in that framework , they can determine when , and how other people trust is that the other person is worthy .
Thank you .
Since the beginnings of computers we 've been working on is working the separation between us and digital information , the separation between our world and the world of the screen of the screen that 's <unk> , and the world of the screen that 's <unk> can be <unk> .
This separation has gone down , getting more and more , to such , to such a point that today 's less than one millimeter , the thickness of a tactile screen , has become accessible to everyone .
But I wonder , and if there were no barriers ?
I started to imagine what it would be like .
First of all , I created this tool that comes into digital space , so that when the strong <unk> of the display was its physical body body .
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly directly into it , and surgeons can practice virtual organs under the screen .
So with this tool , you break the barriers .
But the two hands remain still up outside the screen .
How do you get inside and interacting with digital information using digital information using all the hands of hands ?
In the Science division of Microsoft Science , along with my head <unk> <unk> , <unk> the computer and transformed a little bit of space on the keyboard in a digital field of work .
And so , by combining a transparent bombsight with cameras to detect the fingers and the face , now , you can raise your hands on the side of the keyboard , get to the inside of 3D space , get to the inside of 3D space , to get the pixels directly into the hands .
As windows and archives have a location in real space , it 's as easy as windows like taking a book out of a shelf .
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that 's below every floating screen .
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands with the hands .
In these examples , we 're typing in the digital world .
And if we invest the papers and make the digital information come to us ?
Surely many of us will have bought and returned with the Internet .
Now that does n't have to worry .
What I 've got here is an online <unk> of the Internet .
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device or rotate when the system understands the geometry of your body .
If we took this idea further , I thought , instead of just seeing pixels in the space , how can we make them physical so that we can touch it in a space , so we can make them physical and feel them ?
How would a future be like this ?
At the MIT Media Lab in MIT Hiroshi Ishii , and my fellow Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator <unk> , we created this only physical pixel .
This spherical imam behaves like a 3D pixel in space , which means that the computer pixel as the computer can move the object into any place within this small three-dimensional space .
<unk> , what we did was that gravity 's gravity and control the movement by a combination of levitation and identify mechanical and detectors .
And by programming , in the object , we 're released from the constraints of time and space , which means that human movements can come back and reproduce , and they 're going to reproduce , and they 're always in the physical world .
You can teach them physically , they can actually teach and the famous shot for Michael Jordan , and the famous shot 's shot out of `` physical Jordan , you can play it as a physical reality we want . ''
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets , the physics , and , unlike monitors or monitors textbooks or text books , this is a real powerful , palpable experience . ''
But what 's more fascinating about changing the physical parts of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities .
As you see , digital information is not going to show us something , but starting to act directly on us as part of us as part of the physical world around us , without us with our world .
We started the talk today about a barrier , but if we suppress that barrier , the only boundary that 's left is our imagination .
Thank you .
I became <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> , China , in the '70s .
When I was in first grade , the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses .
But my mother tiger , my tiger mother was , `` No . ''
My parents wanted me to become engineering , like them .
After surviving the Cultural Revolution , I strongly believe there was only an accurate path towards happiness .
No matter if I work work , I would n't want to .
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer .
This was me in my imaginary piano .
An opera singer must start to <unk> from very young to learn the tricks , and so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school .
I even wrote to him the director of the school and the host of radio radio show you .
But no adult gets the idea .
No adult took me seriously .
Only my friends were supportive , but they were kids , without authority , like me .
So at the age of 15 , 15 years , I knew it was already too much higher to train .
My dream will never happen .
I was afraid , that during the rest of my life a second class happiness for the only thing I could aspire to .
And this was so unfair .
So I resolved to play another calling .
Did anybody do all around me wanted to teach me ? Okay .
Let me tell the books .
[ `` Modern Art . '' ] [ `` <unk> Legend . '' ] [ `` <unk> Legend ) [ `` <unk> de History '' ] [ `` <unk> publishable '' ] -- I came to the America .
Those who were banned from China , of course .
`` The Good Earth '' is about Chinese Chinese life .
And it 's not propaganda propaganda . <unk> .
The Bible is interesting , but odd .
That 's one thing to another day .
But the fifth commandment of me was an epiphany : `` <unk> your father and your mother . ''
`` <unk> , '' I said , `` It 's so different , much better I obey . ''
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> trap , and to reset the relationship with my parents .
I find it with a new culture led to my new reading habit .
It would be a lot of perspectives .
For example , at first this map , it seemed to me outside , because this is what the students in China learn .
I had never thought , that China did n't have happened to be in the world 's center .
A map involves perspective of people .
Now comparative reading is not new .
It 's common practice in the academic world .
There are all fields of research fields and comparative literature and comparative literature .
Comparing and contrast , it offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject .
And I thought that if you reading comparative reading work to investigate , why do n't we do it in everyday life ?
So I started reading books from two to two .
They can be treated like `` Benjamin Franklin . '' ] [ `` Narrator : `` John Adams . '' ] [ `` David Franklin ] who were involved in in a same way , or friends with shared experiences . ''
By Christ , temptation are economic and political , spiritual and spiritual .
For the Buddha , they 're all psychological : lust , fear and social duty -- interesting .
If you know another language , it 's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
[ `` The Abraham Path '' Thomas <unk> ] [ `` The Road March '' Alan <unk> ] Instead of getting lost a lot of it .
For example , it 's through the translation that I realized that `` happiness '' in Chinese literally means `` fast joy . '' Ha !
And `` girlfriend , '' in Chinese , literally means `` new mother .
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people of the past and the present .
I know I 'm not going to feel like anything or powerless .
Having a broken dream is really not nothing compared to what many others have suffered from .
I 've come to believe that fulfillment is not the only purpose of a dream .
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that come from the dreams , where the passion comes , where happiness comes from happiness .
Until a dream dream can do for you .
And it 's because of books , which I am here , happy , with purpose , and with clarity , most of the time for the time .
So , books always join them .
Thank you .
Thank you .
When I was in my <unk> , I saw my first client of psychotherapy .
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley .
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex .
And Alex came in the first session with a jeans session and a <unk> afternoon , I took off my office and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men .
When I heard this , I was so relieved .
My class companion had had a <unk> <unk> .
And I got a <unk> I who wanted to talk about men .
I thought I could get a handle .
But I did n't .
With the stories , that Alex brought to the sessions , it became easy to just move my head out while they 're going to make it .
`` The 30s are New 20 '' 20 , '' saying Alex , and for what I saw , she was right .
You start working after , you 're home later , it 's got kids later , until death happens next .
For <unk> , like Alex and I had some kind of time out .
But soon after , my supervisor was forced me to press the Alex that I 'd talk about his loving life about love .
I was resistant .
I said , `` Of course , he 's coming out with guys under his category , lying with a <unk> <unk> , but it 's not like if it was to marry him . ''
And then my supervisor , my supervisor said , `` No , but maybe they get married next .
Also , the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they get married .
This is what psychologists call a moment `` Aha ! ''
It was when I realized that the '30s , are not the new <unk> .
Yes , people feel head back after what was used , but this did n't make the judge of Alex was a pause on in their development .
This made it , the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time , and we were throwing it out .
So I realized , that this kind of benign kind of problem was a real problem and I had not just Alex and loving life , not just to Alex and loving life , but for careers , families and future <unk> , the future and futures of all <unk> .
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States today .
That means 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you think it 's all the time you think it 's the old age of getting out .
Hands up if you 're in your <unk> .
I want to see the <unk> right here .
Oh , yeah ! They 're amazing .
If you work with <unk> , you love a watt , you can take a Democrat 's dream , I want to see . Okay . Incredible , the real <unk> , really matter .
This is not just my opinion . These are the facts .
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be going to be 35 years of life .
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and `` Aha ! '' which gives you a way of life that you have to have 30 and so forth .
People over 40 , they do n't panic .
This audience is going to be okay , I think .
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we will win .
We know more than half of Americans are married , they 're married , or they 're coming out with their future partner at 30 years .
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage growth in its own <unk> and <unk> stage for adults , which means that if there is something they want to change from themselves . It 's now the time to change it .
We know that personality change more times as long as you think of life than at any time of life , and we know that female fertility is going to be complicated to the top 28 .
<unk> are the moment for education about their body and their choices .
When we think about the development of the child , we all know that the first five years is critical for language and attachment .
It 's a time when your daily life and ordinary life has a <unk> impact on the person they 'll be going .
But what we do n't hear often is that there 's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development .
But this is not what the <unk> are listening .
The newspapers talk about changes in the time of adulthood .
Now , researchers call them an extended adolescence .
Journalists are all dumb names like `` <unk> '' as `` <unk> '' and `` <unk> . ''
It 's true .
As a culture , we have considered a triviality , which is actually the decade that defines the age of adulthood .
Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve things you need a plan and not enough plan .
It 's not true ?
What do you think it happens when you give a blockage on your head and tell you , `` Do you have 10 years to start your life ? ''
Nothing happens .
They stole that into that person , the sense of urgency and ambition , absolutely nothing .
And then every day , smart , smart , interesting , like you or your children and daughters come in to my office and say something like that , `` I know my boyfriend 's not good good for me , but you 're going , `` I know that relationship . I 'm just killing time . ''
Or they say , `` Everybody 's going to start a career before 30 , everything 's 30 . ''
But then it starts to sound like this : `` My <unk> , and I still have nothing to show up . ''
I had better rsum wonder the day I graduated from college . ''
And then it starts to sound like this : `` My dates during the <unk> <unk> .
They all ran up and <unk> , but then at some point around the age of 30 , the music went off and all began to sit down .
I did n't want to be the only one that you would stop standing stop , so I sometimes think I married my husband , because he was married the nearest chair . ''
Where are the <unk> here ?
Do n't do that .
Well , that sounds a bit extreme , but do n't tell , the risks are very high .
When you leave a lot of things for the '30s , there 's tremendous pressure at age in 30s , and so many of many of all , a race to take a career , choose a couple , and you 're going to have two or three children in a time a couple of time .
Many of these things are not compatible , and there are research that they start to show , which is much more difficult , and they 're going to show that it 's much more difficult , and you need to do everything from once the '30s .
The <unk> crisis is not about buying <unk> cars .
It 's about realizing you ca n't have the career to you .
You know , you ca n't have the son that you want now , or you ca n't give a brother to your son .
A lot of <unk> and <unk> look at themselves , and I was sitting in the room , and they talk about his <unk> , `` What was you doing ? What was I doing ? What was I thinking ? ''
I want to change what you 're doing and thinking .
Here 's a story about how it could be .
It 's a story about a woman named Emma .
By 25 , Emma came to my office because I was , in his own words , having an identity crisis , having an identity crisis .
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment , but it still ca n't be deciding , so I spent the last years working as a <unk> .
As it was cheaper , it was living with a boyfriend who showed more interested than ambition .
And despite a very difficult deal , very difficult life , his previous life had been even more difficult .
They often tend to be in our sessions , but then she was up , she himself was to say , `` You do n't choose to your family , but you can choose to your friends . ''
Well , one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost all the time for almost all the time .
I had just bought a new book book for surveillance , and I had spent the whole morning , <unk> with his many contacts , but then you 've got to see the empty space that goes after the words `` emergency event , please call ... '' `` Please call ... ''
I was about the hysteria when he looked at me and he said , `` Who is going to be for me if I have a car accident ? ''
Who 's going to take care of me if cancer ? ''
At that point , I got a lot of work hard , to resist , `` I do . ''
What Emma needed was not a clue .
Emma needed a better life , and I knew this was his opportunity .
I had learned a lot from that I worked with Alex as to just sit while the greatest decade of Emma from Emma was in front .
So for the next weeks , for the next weeks , I said to Emma three things that everything , man , man or woman , she deserves to know .
First , I said to Emma , that he would forget that of that identity crisis and identity capital of identity .
As an identity capital , I mean doing something that will add value to your person .
Doing something that is an investment of what they want to be later on .
I did n't know the future for Emma 's career , and no one knows about the future of work , but I know this : identity capital creates capital of identity .
So now is the time for that work on the other side of the country , from that boarding school that you want to try .
I 'm not <unk> exploring <unk> exploration , which , by the way , it 's not exploration .
It 's <unk> .
I said to Emma that I would explore jobs and make them count .
Second , I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk> .
The best friends are great to take you at the airport , but the <unk> they come together with friends with similar minds that are limited in terms of how much of you who you know , about , how do you think , how do you think , how do you think , how do you talk about , and where do you work .
That new piece of capital , that new person who will come out almost always comes from their own circle .
The new things come from what they 're called weak friends of friends from friends of their friends .
Yes , half of <unk> have a bad job or no work .
But the other half is not , and the other half do n't , the <unk> ties to this group .
Half the jobs , half of the problems they 've never been published , then , to meet the head of your neighbor of your neighbor is a way to get a job not published .
It 's not cheating . It 's the science of how information is happening .
Finally , not less important , Emma thinks you do n't choose to your family , but do your friends .
This was true when I was growing up , but like like <unk> , Emma suddenly <unk> his family , when he has a partner and form their own family .
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come out .
You may think that the age of 30 is better age to sit down that 20 or even the 25 , and I agree that the 25 , and I agree that the 20 , and I agree with you .
But choose to the person that you 're living with now or you 're going to tell you now , when you all on Facebook begin to walk towards the altar start , it 's not progress .
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have , and that involves being so intentional in love as you are at work .
<unk> your family must be aware of who and what you want to do instead will work in just make it work or just kill the time , and you 're going to have a conscious amount of time will work or kill time with anyone .
So what happened to Emma ?
Well , we looked at that phone , and she found a fellow in the room in a cousin of a cousin working in a museum art museum in another state .
This weak link helped to get a job out there .
That 's the job supply that I was a reason to leave to leave the boyfriend with .
Now , five years later , it 's special of events in museums .
She was married to a man who chose them consciously .
I love her new career , he loves his new family , and I sending me a letter that was saying , `` Now the emergency contacts now , I said , `` Now the <unk> spaces are n't big enough . ''
The story of Emma may sound easy , but that 's what I love with <unk> .
It 's very easy to help you .
<unk> are like aircraft coming out of Los Angeles airport that come out somewhere in the West .
Right before the launch , light adjustment in its trajectory makes the difference in its trajectory that makes land in Alaska or Fiji .
In the same way , at the age of 21 , a good conversation , a good conversation , a good conversation , a good TED Talk , can you have a good TED talk that can have huge effects over the next few years or even the next generation .
Here 's my notion worth spreading to all the <unk> .
It 's as simple as I learned what I learned to Alex .
It 's what I 've got the privilege of saying to <unk> every day like Emma every day : <unk> is not the new <unk> , <unk> , <unk> their old age , use their weak ties to choose your weak ties and choose your family capital .
Do n't get to define why they did n't know what they did .
They 're deciding today .
Thank you .
When I was 27 years old , I left a very tough job to management for a job that was even more picky : faculty .
I went to teach students mathematics by students in New York City in New York City .
And as any teacher , I applied tests and test .
I gave them tasks .
When I work , it would go back the grades .
What struck me was that I.Q . was n't the only difference between my best best and my best students .
Some of those who had a better performance did n't have <unk> I.Q . <unk> .
Some of my smartest children were n't doing so well .
And that set of me thinking .
The kinds of things they need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade , they 're safe : they 're difficult : proportions , <unk> , the area of a given parallelogram .
But these things are not impossible , and they were very convinced that every one of my students could have to learn the lesson if they worked hard , to learn the lesson if they worked hard , and for good time .
After several years of faculty , I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective , from a psychological perspective .
In education , the only thing we know how to measure best .
It 's the <unk> , but what if you have successful in school and life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn in a quick way and to learn ?
So I left the classrooms , and I went to college in college to become a psychologist .
I started studying children and adults in all kind of challenging scenarios , and in every study my question was , who has a success here and why ?
My research team and I went on to the army 's West Academy , and I went to the US military .
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> are in military training , and who are <unk> .
We went to the National <unk> , and we 're trying to predict what children would be as far as possible in the competition .
We studied teachers amateurs working neighborhoods really hard , what teachers still are going to be teaching them to the end of the school year , in the school of those students to be the more effective at learning about the learning results of their students going to be ?
We teamed up with private companies , asking , which of these marketers are going to maintain their job work ?
And who is going to make more money ?
In all these very different context , in all these different backgrounds , a feature like success points emerged .
And it was n't social intelligence .
It was n't the good appearance , physical health , not I.Q .
It was .
Determination is passion and perseverance to achieving goals goals .
Determination is to have resistance .
Determination is to hang into your future , day after day , not just a week , not just a month , not just a month , but for years and working really hard to make that future .
Determination is to live life like a marathon , not a career at all speed .
A few years ago , I started studying determination at the public schools in Chicago .
I asked thousands of high school students that made my purpose questionnaires and then waited over a year to see about more than a year to see who they were going .
It turns out , the kids with more determination significantly greater chances of graduate , even when I paired in every feature that I could measure , things like family income , the results of the standardized testing , even the security that they felt when they were in school .
So it 's not just in West Point , or <unk> National <unk> where determination matters . It 's also in school , especially for kids at risk of <unk> .
For me , the most shocking thing about determination is how little of you know how little science is about development .
Every day , parents and teachers , ask me , `` How do you change the purpose in kids ?
What should I be doing to teach kids a solid weapon hard ?
How do you keep them so motivated for the long term ? ''
The most honest answer is : I do n't know . What I know is that talent do n't give you purpose .
Our data show very clearly that there are lots of talented individuals that are simply not going to go forward with their commitments .
In fact , in our data , that 's commonly related or related to the data , or even related to interest in talent .
Until now , the best idea I 've ever heard about developing the purpose in the children is something called growth mindset .
This is an idea at Stanford University by Carol <unk> , and it 's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed , that it 's the belief that the ability to learn it 's not fixed .
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and they learn about the brain and they learn about the answer to the challenge , they 're much more likely to get them when they fail , because they do n't think that failure is a permanent condition .
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop determination .
But we need more .
And that 's where I will end my speech , because that 's where we are .
That 's the work we have ahead .
We need to take our best ideas , our strongest intuitions , and we need to test them .
We need to measure if they 've been successful , and we need to be willing to fail , and to get it wrong , to start all of the lessons that we learned .
In other words , we need to be determined about making our children are more determined .
Thank you .
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter 's daughter , one of my most <unk> memories , is my mother <unk> beauty , shape and the figure of the Chinese character .
Since that moment , I 'm going through this incredible language .
But for a foreign , it seems to be as impenetrable as China is China .
In the last few years , I 've been asking myself if I can break down this wall , so that anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language sophisticated .
I started thinking about how a new new way and fast to learn Chinese might be useful .
Since I was five years old , I began to learn how to draw each strokes of every single character in the right sequence .
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years .
Since we only have five minutes , it 's better than we do it in a faster , simple way .
A Chinese academic academic : <unk> 20,000 characters .
You only need a thousand to understand the basic literacy .
The first 200 will will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature , enough to read out of traffic signals , restaurant menus , understand the basic idea of websites , or the newspapers .
Today I will start with eight to show how the method works .
Are you ready ?
You open your mouth as much as it can be possible until it 's a square possible , it 's square .
You get a mouth .
This is a person who is going to give a walk .
<unk> .
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides , as if it was shouting out there , `` <unk> ! I 'm burning ! '' This is actually a symbol that 's actually originally called it , but I like to believe it 's in the other way . The one that I 'll make you .
This is a tree .
tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree
This is a mountain .
The sun .
The moon .
And the symbol of the door , looks like a couple of <unk> in the old west .
I call these eight characters to these eight characters .
They 're building blocks so they create a lot more characters .
One person .
If someone walks back , that 's going to go on .
As the old said , two are a company , three is a crowd .
If one person stretches your arms , this person is saying , `` It was that big . ''
The person inside the mouth , the person is caught .
It 's a prisoner , like <unk> inside the whale .
A tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have a forest .
Three trees together , we also have the forest .
Put a table under the tree , we have the foundations have .
Put a mouth on the tree , that 's a `` idiot '' Easy Easy to remember , because a tree is a <unk> .
Remember the fire ?
Two together , it gets very hot .
Three fires , that 's a lot of flames .
Put the fire under the two trees , that 's burning .
For us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
Two suns together , thriving .
Three together , those are flashes .
Put the sun and the moon shining together , that 's the brightness .
It also means tomorrow , after one day and one night .
The sun comes out on the horizon . <unk> .
A door . Put a table inside the door , is the deadbolt on the door .
Put a mouth inside your door , you take a question .
Do you know , played someone at home ?
This person 's going to be hidden from a door , fleeing <unk> .
On the left , we have a woman .
Two women together , they 're discussing .
Three women together , be careful is adultery .
So we 've already gone through almost 30 characters .
By using this method , the first eight radical is going to allow them to build 32 .
The next group of eight characters will build another 32 .
So with every little effort , they 'll be able to learn a couple hundred and hundreds of characters , which is the same thing that learns to learn a hundred years .
So after the character , we started creating sentences .
For example , the mountain and the fire together , we have a <unk> . It 's a volcano .
We know that Japan is the land of the rising sun .
This is a sun placed with the origin , because Japan is on this China in China .
So a sun at the beginning , we created Japan .
A person behind Japan , what do we have ?
A Japanese person .
The character on the left is two mountains , one on the other .
In the ancient China , that meant in exile , because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their own political enemies beyond the mountains .
Today , the exile has become to come out .
A mouth that tells you where to go out is an exit .
This is a slide to remind myself that I have to stop talking and go down the stage . Thank you .
What I prefer to be dad are the movies I get to see .
I love to share my favorite movies with my children , when my daughter was four years , saw the magician 's magician was four years old .
The film mastered his imagination for months .
Her favorite character was <unk> , of course .
He gave a good excuse to wear a brilliant dress and take a magic wand .
But when you see that movie so many times , you get to understand that it 's extraordinary .
We now live and we raise our kids into a kind of complex kind of industrial endeavor .
However , the magician of Oz was an event in itself .
It did not start that trend .
The trend really took rise to a rise was later with , interestingly , another film , whose actors , a <unk> guy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> young boy , <unk> a <unk> young boy like the enemy .
Do you know what I 'm talking about ?
There 's a big difference between these two movies , there 's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies we see today .
One is that there are very little violence in the magician of Oz .
The monkeys are pretty aggressive , as an apple .
But I think if the magician of Oz is doing today , the magician would say , `` Dorothy , you 're Dorothy , you 're Dorothy , you 're Dorothy of Oz as the prophecy .
You use magical shoes to defeat the armies that you 've played the evil evil <unk> .
But that 's not what happens .
Another unique thing in Oz at Oz is that the most heroic , wise , and then get women , wise .
I started to notice this when I did Star Wars on my daughter , a few years later , and the situation was different .
At that time , I also had a son .
About three years .
I was n't invited to the projection from that .
But it was the second son , and the level of <unk> , and so slid in the room , and she was stunned impressed as a mother leg with his paw behind , and I do n't think he understood as a leg with his leg to behind , and I do n't think he understood .
I wonder what perceived .
Would you be issues of courage , perseverance and loyalty ?
Would the sensation that Luke get an army to remove the government ?
Let 's compare this to the magician 's magician of 1939 .
How do you have Dorothy his movie ?
We do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk> .
It 's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow Oz , right ? and not a world of men who are fighting , which is where we are .
Why is there so much capital capital F , why is the films for our children , and so little on the way of yellow bricks ?
There 's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls , and they should read it . It 's very good .
I 've not read so much about how kids react to this stimulus .
Yes , for experience that <unk> princess does not give me the proper framework that I would have served with the right framework for the adult who was blended together , and I think it 's in the first kiss of the first kiss , really expected .
My search for search has ended , I have a girlfriend .
Why do you stand up there ?
I do n't know what I should do .
The movies are focused on defeat and getting their reward , and they do n't leave time for other relationships or other adventures .
It 's almost like being a kid , you have to be a dumb animal , and if you 're a girl , you have to use a warrior .
There are many exceptions , and to defend the eyewitness princess before any of you .
But they send a message to the kids , although they are , kids , they 're not really objective public public .
They do a phenomenal job when girls to teach girls against the patriarchy , but they do n't necessarily show kids how to defend themselves from patriarchy .
There 's no model for them .
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children , so real and charming and charming like <unk> and <unk> , but they do n't stop being films of being war .
Of course , the most successful theme of all time on it continues to come up with classic after classical and each of them on the adventure of a child or a man , or a man , or a man , or two men , you 're friends , you know .
Until many of you , you 're thinking about this year , finally came out .
I recommend all . It 's available in shops .
Do you remember what the criticism came in ?
I ca n't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a princess .
It 's very good . Do n't let it out !
Well , almost any of these films , the <unk> test test .
I do n't know if you 've heard about this .
It 's still not completely thrown , but maybe now we 're going to start a movement .
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist , and in the mid-'80s in the mid-'80s , I recorded a conversation I 'd had a conversation about the evaluation of the movies that you saw .
And it 's very simple . There are just three questions you need : In the movie , there 's just more than a female character that has lines ?
So , you have to fulfill .
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie ?
Your conversations are on top of your kid that you like ? Okay ? Thank you . Thank you very much .
Two women who exist , and they talk about things in each other .
It happens . I 've seen it , and yet I 'm very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love .
In fact , this week , I went to see a very good <unk> film , <unk> .
Right ? <unk> Oscar successfully , a consensus idea of what is a Hollywood Hollywood movie .
Virtually , it 's not the test test .
And I do n't think it should , because a lot of the movie , I do n't know if you 've seen , a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and men are hidden in the embassy where men and women are hiding in the hostage .
We have a lot of little scenes from the men who have deep , painful conversations , and it 's the great time for one of the actors to take a look down the door and say , `` You come to bed , honey ?
This is Hollywood .
So let 's go through the numbers .
In 2011 , of the 100 movies more popular , how many of them do have female protagonists ?
Eleven . Not bad .
It 's not the same percentage than the number of women that have chosen recently to Congress recently for Congress , so it 's okay .
But there 's a bigger number that 's going to disappoint this room this room .
Last year , The New York Times published a study that the government had done .
This is what he said .
In the United States , one of every five women says that has been sexually assaulted ever in his life .
I do n't think it 's the fault of mass entertainment .
I do n't think that movies for children have something to do with that .
I also do n't think that music videos or pornography , are tightly linked , but something 's wrong , and when I hear that statistics , one of the things that I think , one of the things I think , is a lot of sexual <unk> .
Who are these guys ? What are those guys learning ?
What do you do to learn ?
They 're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero , defeat the villain with violence and then charge the reward , which is a woman who does n't have friends and talk ?
So , we are <unk> that story ?
You know , as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing , we find this world , and this really startling statistic and we want to do it .
We have tools to our disposal of disposal as <unk> , and we hope that it will help , but I have to ask ourselves , <unk> <unk> is going to be active if it , at the same time , active our children have to be able to keep their male power ?
I mean , I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important , and I 'm talking mainly to parents .
I think we have to show our kids new definition of manhood to manhood that I think we need to show our children new definition of manhood .
The definition of manhood is radically changing .
You 'll have read about how new economics is changing the role that you care about home and <unk> .
It 's all changing .
When I asked my daughter , what was his favorite favorite character 's favorite character character ? ''
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> .
What do you have in common these two ?
Maybe it 's not just brilliant .
I think they 're experts .
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone , and they love to share their knowledge with other people , and they love their knowledge with other people to reach their own potential .
They are leaders .
I like that kind of stories for my daughter , and I like that kind of stories for my son .
I want more stories like that .
I want fewer stories where I 'm telling my son : `` Go and fight only and more stories , where you see that work is to join a team , perhaps , a team led by women , to help other people better and be better people , like the magician of Oz . ''
Thank you .
As a child , I was living in Maine , and one of the things that I was most like was to look for the sea cookies on the shores of Maine , because my parents said that would give me luck .
But you know , it 's hard to find these shells .
They are covered with sand , and it 's hard to see them .
However , with the time , I got used to them .
I started to see patterns and patterns that helped me to build it out .
This became a passion to find things , in a love of past and archaeology .
And finally , when I started studying <unk> , I realized to see with my own eyes was not enough .
Because , suddenly in Egypt , my little beach little beach in Maine had grown up with one of nearly 1,300 miles long .
And my sea cookies had grown up the size of cities .
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery .
To try to do a map of the past , I knew I had to do a map .
I want to show you an example of how different we see by the infrared infrared .
This is a place located at the eastern Delta , in Egypt , called <unk> .
And the place , in the naked eye , seems to be brown , but when we use the infrared , we process it using false color , suddenly , it looks like bright pink .
What you 're looking at is the actual chemical changes in the landscape caused by building materials , and the ancient Egyptians .
I want to share with you how we 've used the satellite data to find an ancient <unk> city , called <unk> , loss for thousands of years .
<unk> was the capital of ancient Egypt for over 400 years now called the Middle Empire 's about 4,000 years ago .
The place in El <unk> , Egypt , and it 's really important because in the Middle Empire , there was this great renaissance there , there was this great renaissance of Egyptian in the old Egyptian , the architecture and religion .
<unk> always have known that <unk> , somewhere near the pyramids of both the two kings that they were built , come down here in the red circles here , but somewhere within the red circles of these <unk> .
This area is enormous , about six miles per mile .
Before , the Nile lasts right on the side of <unk> and as he changed over time , he moved to the east and covered in the city .
So how do you find a city below a long landscape ?
And I 'm trying to find out random a needle , would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a haystack , blindfolded and using baseball gloves .
So , we use NASA data to make a map of the place , very subtle changes .
We were able to see where the Nile could be .
But you can see more detail , and it 's even more interesting , this area slightly that you see inside the circle here , which we think might be the location of <unk> .
So we 're going to collaborate with Egyptian scientists , they can actually sampling this way .
When I say sampling , it 's kind of like you sample it 's ice , but instead of layers of climate change , we 're looking sampling human occupation .
Five meters down below a thick mud layer , we found a dense layer of <unk> , and we found a dense layer of pottery .
This means that in this possible location of <unk> , five feet down , we have a occupation of occupation of several hundred years than date of the Middle Empire 's date , exactly the same period we think is <unk> .
We also find jobs from <unk> , <unk> , quartz and cat ; what shows you that there was a jewelry shop .
This might seem like it 's not a lot , but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry store , these are the rocks they used .
So , we have a dense layer of occupation that goes from the Middle Empire 's site .
We also have evidence from an elite jewelry shop that proves that what 's been there , it was a very important city .
We still do n't find any <unk> here in the near future to localize it in a near future to localize it .
And even more important , we have the resources to train young Egyptians on the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries .
I want to end up with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire 's four years ago : it was probably written by 4,000 years ago .
To share knowledge , knowledge is the most <unk> .
There 's nothing like that on Earth .
So apparently , TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C .
Make ideas really happen in 1984 B.C . In a lost city , not for a long time and found from the high .
It certainly takes the search of seamounts in perspective .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
I want to invite you from close your eyes .
Imagine standing outside the door of <unk> house .
I 'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door , the material that he 's made out of .
Now , we were <unk> a group of obese bikes .
They 're competing in a <unk> race , and they 're going in the direction of their entry door .
I need to see this really .
They 're loud <unk> , and they 're sweating , so much .
And they collide up against the door of their house .
There are bicycles flying around all over the parts , wheels that go on their side , rays of the wheels they end up in <unk> places . <unk> line .
In the lobby , the hall , or what 's on the other side of the door , and look at the quality of the light , the light shines on the <unk> of the <unk> .
You 're waving with her hand .
It was a brown horse on a brown horse .
It 's a horse talking .
You can feel your blue fur , you can put up on your nose .
You can smell the cookie cookie and you can see it 's about to get into the mouth .
<unk> the one side and go out of your living room .
Already in the room , and making use of their imagination , imagine Britney Spears .
It 's with little clothes , dancing over your home of downtown , singing `` <unk> One More Time More Time . ''
Now follow me on the kitchen .
The ground has been covered with a yellow <unk> path and since the oven comes to you Dorothy , <unk> Man , <unk> Man , and the Len , `` The Wizard of Oz , '' <unk> , <unk> for you .
Okay . Open your eyes .
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition competition , every spring in New York City .
It 's called the <unk> of the United States in the United States . ''
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist , waiting for , I guess , that this was kind of like the end of a wise <unk> of wisdom .
There were several men and a few of these different ages and different habits of hygiene .
They were memorizing hundreds of numbers of random numbers , looking at them just once .
<unk> the names of dozens and dozens of strangers .
We 're using whole poems in just minutes .
<unk> to see who he could memorize the very quickly the order of a cards of the cards .
And I thought , `` This is amazing . ''
These people have to be phenomena from nature .
And I started talking with some of the competitors .
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and have one of the best trained memories of it .
I said , `` Ed , when you realized you were a wise ? ''
Ed said , `` I 'm not a wise man .
Actually , I have a average memory .
Everybody involved in this competition , they say they have normal memory .
`` We 've been trained to do these miraculous memory acts of memory using some ancient old , two years ago in Greece , the same techniques that used Cicero to memorize their speeches , and that the medieval academic academics used to memorize entire books . ''
And my reaction was , `` Wow . How do you have n't heard this before ? ''
We were standing outside the classroom , and Ed , who 's a wonderful , brilliant English , although a little bit of crank , he said , `` Josh , you 're a American journalist , you 're a journalist , you 're an American journalist .
You know Britney Spears ? ''
And I said , `` What ? No , why ?
`` Because I 'd like to teach Britney Britney to memorize the order in a deck of cards live on national television . ''
That would prove the world anyone can do . ''
And I said , `` Well , I 'm not Britney Spears , but maybe you can teach me .
I mean , you have to start for something ? ''
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me .
I ended up spending most of the year 's year not only training my memory but also <unk> , trying to understand how it works , why does it work , why it 's going to be its potential .
I met a bunch of people really interesting .
This is a man called <unk> .
He 's <unk> , very likely to be the worst memory in the world .
Her memory was so bad did n't even remember it had a memory problem ; it 's awesome .
Somebody incredibly tragic , but it was a window that allows them to see what our memory makes us who we are .
At the other end of the spectrum , I met this man .
This is Kim <unk> . He 's based on the paper of <unk> Hoffman in `` Rain Man . ''
We went in a evening together in Salt Lake City , memorizing by phone books , memorizing phone books .
And when I come back , I read a number of treated on the memory makes something over 2,000 years ago in Latin , in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages .
And I learned a lot about really interesting things .
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time in having the idea of being trained , disciplined and disciplined , was not as rare as it can seem like today .
It 's a long time ago , people to invest in their memory to provide their minds .
These techniques have made possible in our modern modern world , but they also have changed .
They have culturally changed , and I would argue that they 've changed us as well .
As we do n't have to remember , sometimes it seems like we 've forgotten how we have to do it .
And one of the last places on our planet where people are passionate about the idea of being passionate about this idea of being trained , disciplined and saturated , is this competition by memory .
It 's not so unique ; it 's competencies like this all over the world .
I was fascinated , I wanted to know how these people do .
A few years ago , a group of University of London invited into London invited a group of memory champions in the lab .
You wanted to know : Is it going to have a sense of brains in some way , structural or different or different from the rest of us ?
The answer was , not .
Are you smarter than the rest ?
They gave them a cognitive test , and the answer was actually not .
It had a really significant difference between the brains and memory of the memory champions and you compared them to the comparison .
When they put them in an MRI machine , they <unk> their brains while they 're looking at numbers , faces and forms of faces and faces and forms it into memory parts , they found that in the memory champions <unk> parts , different from the brain .
They actually used them , or they seemed to use , a part of the brain that involves spatial memory , a part of spatial and navigation .
Why ? Is there something that we can learn from this ?
The tournament for competitive memorization is driving like an armed career where each year comes up with a new way of remembering someone 's got a new way to remember , and then the rest of the competitors to do that day .
This is my friend Ben <unk> , three times champion of course .
On his desk , there 's 36 <unk> of him out there , so he 's a point to try to memorize him in an hour of trying to memorize it in an hour , wearing a technique that he invented , using a technique that he invented .
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise precise order of random digits .
About half an hour . Yes .
And while there 's a lot of a lot of ways of remembering things in these skills , absolutely all of all the techniques used to the end , just reduced a concept that psychologists call <unk> .
It illustrates with an elegant paradox known as a paradox called `` <unk> . ''
That 's his last name .
And then I ask you , `` Remember there . ''
And when I go back later , and I ask you , `` Do you remember that word that I told you a while ? ''
`` You remember what it was ? ''
The person he said that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person he said that his job is `` <unk> . ''
The same word , different capacity I remember -- that 's weird .
What happens here ?
Well , the name Baker -- it does n't mean anything for you .
With all the other memories they dance through their head .
But the word `` <unk> '' -- we know that it 's a lot .
They wear white hats .
They have flour .
They 're going to be fine when they go home .
You probably meet some baker .
And when we do that word for the first time , we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some back time .
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this data data ago in Greece .
It 's known as the `` palace of memory . ''
The story is like this : There was a poet called <unk> .
He had hired them as entertainment , because before , if I wanted to give a very good party at a <unk> , it was not brought to a poet .
He stood up , <unk> his memory for memory , and left , and so soon it was , the classroom broke up , collapsed .
They killing everyone .
But not only killed everyone , but it shattered into the bodies , and then it shattered them .
No one could say who was there , nobody could remember where they were sitting there .
So they could n't put the bodies off .
A tragedy behind the other .
<unk> , standing outside , only survivor , in the midst of the eyes closed , and realized that with his eyes of his mind , I could shut down the eyes of his mind .
I took the family 's family <unk> where their loved ones were in the rubble .
What <unk> noticed at that moment is something we all know sort of intuitively , and it 's that no matter about it , and it 's that no matter whether we 're not good at remembering or names or whether we 're not good at remembering or names or remarkable and remarkable memory .
If I 'm going <unk> the first 10 words of the story that I 've just told you about <unk> , it 's very likely to be very hard to do it .
But I would bet that if you 'll tell you to say who I was sitting on the horse who say who I was sitting on the horse <unk> in his lobby , they would be able to <unk> .
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with your mind 's eyes and the <unk> of images with the things you want to remember -- the more crazy , crazy , crazy , crazy , like <unk> .
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago , to the first treaties of memory , in Latin .
And how does it work ?
Let 's say you 've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk , and you want to do this memory , the same way I would have made it out of it , if they 'd invited it , if they 'd invited it to me .
What you might do is imagine you 're at the door of your house .
And to come up with some sort of ridiculous image , crazy and unforgettable and unforgettable to help you remember that the first thing that you want to mention the first thing you want to talk about is that completely <unk> competition .
And then you can imagine entering your house , and watching the <unk> of the <unk> launched about Ed Ed .
And that would remember that you want to introduce your friend Ed .
And then you would see Britney Spears to remind me to remind you of that funny anecdote that you want to tell .
And then they came into the kitchen , and then the fourth issue that they 'd talk to it would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year , and they have some friends to help them remember them .
That 's what Romans is like <unk> their speeches , not word for word , which is going to confuse them , but typical by typical people who are going to confuse it , but typical by typical .
In fact , the word `` typical '' comes from the Greek `` <unk> , '' which means `` <unk> . ''
It 's a breath of when people thought about speaking , and in the rhetoric with this kind of space of space .
The phrase `` First '' sentence , it would be like the first place in your memory .
I saw that this was just fascinating , and I got stuck with it .
I went to some of these memory skills , and I had the idea of writing something larger about this subculture of competitive <unk> .
But there was a problem .
The problem was that a memory competition is a pathologically boring event .
Seriously , that 's like a lot of people sitting on taking tests , I mean , that 's the most exciting thing that 's going on is when someone will come up the front .
I 'm a journalist , and I need to write about something .
I know there are incredible things happening in these people 's minds , but I do n't have access .
I realized that if I was going to tell this story , I needed to try to put myself in place .
So I began to spend 15 minutes or 20 minutes every morning before I sit at the New York Times , just trying to remember something .
Maybe a poem : or the names of an old school sweetheart , a <unk> market .
And I discovered that this was entertaining .
I 'd never expected it to be it .
It was fun , because it was n't just to train the memory .
What it 's actually about to do is better and better the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous images , cartoons , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the eye of mind .
I was really hooked up with this .
This is me , using my standard training team for memory competition .
It 's a couple of <unk> , covered with tape , covered with tape by just two <unk> , because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory competitor for just a smartphone 's worst enemy .
I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered a year before . I had the idea that he could enter a kind of participatory journalism .
I thought this could be a good job of all of my research .
The problem was that the experiment came out of control .
And I won the competition , something that did n't have to happen .
Of course , it 's nice power to memorize speeches , and phone numbers , and shopping lists , but it 's actually not the point .
These are just tricks .
Because they are based on very basic principles of how the brain works .
And it 's not necessary that it 's going to be able to build away from memory or to memorize cards of cards , to benefit from cards of how your mind works .
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was an innate gift , but it 's not the case .
The great memoirs .
The most basic level , we remember when we pay attention .
You know , when you focus deeply .
The courthouse -- these memory techniques , are just shortcuts .
In fact , it 's not even shortcuts .
They work because they make us <unk> .
It would be a profound processing kind of attention that most of you are n't going to get <unk> out there .
But the reality is no shortcuts .
That 's how things are made up .
And if there 's something I want to leave you with today , that 's what I 'm going to do , the <unk> , which I could n't even remember that I had a memory problem , and I quit , which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories .
How much are we willing to lose what it 's already in our <unk> existence on the Blackberries or not paying attention to being a human being in front of us , who walk to our side . We 're going to be so much <unk> that we do n't even get on the depth ?
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities capabilities in all of us .
But if you want to live a memorable life , you have to be the kind of person you remember remember .
Thank you .
Today I 'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture of architecture .
It 's a lot to cover in 18 minutes .
It 's a complex issue , so I 'll put it out just a complex place : New Jersey .
Because 30 years ago , I am from Jersey older , I was six years old and I lived there at my parents ' home in a town called <unk> , and this was my kid in my child .
In the corner , from my bedroom , I was a bathroom I shared with my sister .
And between my bedroom and the bathroom , there was a balcony that would give the living room .
And there you all spent the time watching TV , and every time I went from my room to the bathroom , everybody , look at me . And every time I went back and I went back , and I just went back and I went back and I went back and I went back and I went back and I went back and I went back and I
And I was like this .
It was awkward , not insecure , and hated .
I hated that tour , I hated that balcony , I hated that balcony , I hated that room , I hated that room . ''
That 's architecture .
Ready .
Those feelings , those emotions that I feel , that 's the power of architecture , because architecture is not about mathematics , or division of areas , but of those gut , but of those gut , but the emotional connections , emotional connections that we deal with .
And it 's not surprising that we feel like that , because with the Environmental Protection Agency , the American Protection Agency , the American 90 percent of their time under the <unk> Agency .
I mean , 90 percent of the time is architecture surrounded by architecture .
That 's a lot .
So architecture determines us in ways that we do n't even realize .
That makes us a little naive and very , very predictable very predictable thing .
This means that when I show you a building like this , I know what it raises you : you think it 's `` power '' and stability and `` democracy . ''
And I know that you think about it by based on a half a half a half a thousand years ago , by the Greeks .
This is a trick .
It 's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection to the ways we build our buildings .
It 's an predictable emotional connection ; we 've used this trick for a long , long time .
We used it 200 years ago to build banks .
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums .
And in the 20th century in the U.S. , we use it to build houses .
Look , these kind of stable <unk> , solid , facing the sea , away from the elements .
This is very , very useful because building stuff is terrifying .
It 's expensive , it takes a long time , and it 's very complicated .
People who are building them and governments and governments are always afraid of innovation , and they prefer to use ways they know that they 're going to work .
So we found ourselves with buildings like this .
It 's a beautiful building .
It 's the <unk> Library that came in 2004 , in my hometown , and , you know , you know , you have a dome ; it has this round thing , columns , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> what <unk> is about to communicate with this building : the children , the kids , the property values , history .
But it does n't have a lot to do with a library today .
That same year , in 2004 , on the other side of the country , the other library , which looks like this .
It 's in Seattle .
So , this library shows how we use media in the digital age .
It 's a new kind of public equipment for the city , a place to meet and read and share .
So how is it possible that the same year , in the same country , two buildings , two buildings , both so-called libraries , be so completely different from it ?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the pendulum .
On one side is innovation , the architects that constantly drive new technologies , new memories , new solutions for life of current life .
<unk> , we 'll just sort of sort of push it out , and get completely out of the people 's completely out of people .
All of black , it 's going to be depressed . You think we feel very well , but we 're dead down because we do n't have another choice .
We need to go on the other side and go back to those symbols appreciated .
So we 're doing it , and we 're all happy , but we 're feeling like <unk> , so we start going to swing back the pendulum , swing the pendulum the pendulum , over and over and over and over , over and over , and we 've done it over the last 300 years .
Well , 30 years ago , we came out from the 1970s .
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called `` <unk> . ''
It has to do with the concrete .
You can guess .
<unk> small , on scale .
Really hard really hard .
So , we 're approaching the '80s , and we started to incorporate those symbols .
We put the pendulum in the other direction , the other direction .
We take those ways we know that you like them .
<unk> neon and we add a pies , and we use new materials .
They love them .
We do n't give <unk> .
We put them together , we turn them into skyscrapers , which can be skyscrapers , that they can be trained from glass events .
The shapes are <unk> , they won in audacity and colorful .
<unk> became columns .
swans grew up to the size of buildings .
Crazy .
But they were the '80s , that was great .
We all spend time in commercial centers , we 're moved to the neighborhoods , and there , in the suburbs , we can create our own architectural fantasies .
Those fantasies could be the Mediterranean , to the French , or the Italian .
It may probably have endless bread .
This is what happens with <unk> .
This is what happens with symbols .
They 're easy , they 're cheap , because instead of creating new spaces , we 're recreating from other places .
I know very well , and all of you know , that 's not the Tuscany .
This is Ohio .
Architects are frustrated and we start to swing the pendulum the pendulum 's swing in the other direction .
In the '80s , in the early '90s , we started to experiment with the so-called <unk> .
And we 're going to find the historical symbols -- we now have new compositions of computer design techniques , and we find out with new compositions , some ways that we 're going against other shapes .
This is academic and <unk> , and it 's <unk> , and you 're completely excluded .
Normally , the pendulum <unk> in the opposite direction .
But then something amazing happened .
In 1997 , this building is opened .
It 's the Guggenheim of Bilbao , of Frank Gehry .
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture .
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when Bilbao was one of these rare moments when Bilbao , academics , in the general public , completely agree on a building .
The New York Times journal <unk> .
The tourism in Bilbao grew up on two percent when they finished the building .
So all of a sudden suddenly , the whole world wanted one of those buildings : Los Angeles , Seattle , Chicago , New York , Cleveland , <unk> .
Everybody wanted one , and Gehry was everywhere .
He was our first star first .
But how is it possible that these shapes , wild and radical and radical , how is it possible that they 're going to become ubiquitous around the world ?
And it happened , because the media went around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism .
We 've created an emotional reaction with these shapes .
Same thing did the top mayors in the world .
So everybody believed that if they had these forms , they had culture and tourism .
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennium phenomenon of other stars happened to happen with other African architects .
It happened to stumble upon us and Libeskind , and what happened to these very little elite architects in the threshold , actually started to spend with all the architecture , digital media started to increase the speed of consumption .
Think , for example , how do architecture use architecture .
A thousand years ago , you would have to have walking up to the next town to see a building .
shipping rises : they can take a ship , they can take a plane , they can be tourists .
<unk> technology . You can see in the newspapers , on the telly , and at the end , we are all of architecture , the building carries beyond the physical location .
So architecture is everywhere now -- that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture .
Because architecture is moving so fast .
It does n't just be very accurate for thinking about a building .
You need a long time to build a building , three or four years of time , and in that time , an architect can actually design two , eight , or 100 , or 100 more buildings , before the which designed four years was a success or not .
Because there 's never been good feedback in architecture .
That 's how we found ourselves with buildings like this .
<unk> was not a two-year movement for two years , but 20 years .
For 20 years , we were building buildings like this because we did n't have any idea how much <unk> .
That 's never going to happen . I think , because we 're on the biggest revolution in the <unk> revolution in architecture from the invention of concrete , steel or elevator revolution .
My theory is that when you apply the pendulum to the media , it starts swing over faster and faster , until you 're going to be in both extreme almost <unk> , and it would effectively be the difference between innovation and symbol , and in fact , the architects , and you , the audience , and you , the public . ''
Now we can do almost <unk> , <unk> symbols , something completely new .
I 'll show you , how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently in .
We went back to replace this building that caught fire .
This is the center of a village called <unk> Island in the state of New York City .
It 's a vacation community .
But that meant that two years before the building was completed , it was already part of the community , and as the drawings looked exactly like drawings looked like that was exactly the end of it .
The building became part of the community . That first summer , when people started going and share it in social media , the building stopped being just a building , it became a means of a media , became a means of a building , it 's the images that you made the building .
And as you use it to tell your story , they become part of the personal narrative , makes it <unk> with collective memory , and that makes the symbols of the collective .
I mean , we do n't need to tell the Greeks .
We can tell each other what we think of architecture , because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us , but they have changed the relationship between us and the buildings .
Think for a second in those librarians <unk> .
If that building was today , first , we went to the Internet for `` new libraries . ''
We 'd be bombarded with some examples of experiment with innovation , about what a library can be .
That 's ammunition .
You know , <unk> you can take <unk> , people from <unk> people , and tell them that there is n't unique response to what is going to be a library today .
Let 's be part of this .
This is abundance of solutions that gives freedom to experience .
It 's all different now .
The architects are no longer such as mysterious creatures who use words and drawings and complicated drawings , and you do n't think it 's a hapless audience that you do n't accept something like before .
The architects can listen , and you do n't leave to architecture by architecture .
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another one another , it 's irrelevant .
In fact , we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society .
This is the end of the history of architecture , and means that buildings in tomorrow will be very different from buildings today .
This means that a public space in the former city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city of <unk> can be unique .
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that it , a stadium in Brooklyn , and not a bad historic <unk> of red brick based on ideas .
This means that some robots can be able to build our buildings , because we will finally be ready to produce the ways they 're going to produce .
And that means that the buildings will become the whims of nature to the whims of nature and not the other .
This means that a parking garage in Miami in Miami Beach that means that you can also serve a sports or for yoga or even you can get married at night .
This means that three architects can kind of swimming in swimming in the East New York City in New York City , and to raise half a million dollars of dollars of community dollars , you 're not a client alone .
It means that no building is too small for innovation , like this little pavilion of <unk> , as <unk> and <unk> like the animals that you 're going to see .
Because no matter whether it 's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings .
It does n't matter how we built , what matters is what we build .
Architects , you know how to make the more ecological , more intelligent , more nice , kind of , smarter , smarter .
We 've been waiting for all of you .
Finally , we 're not on opposite sides .
Find an architect , <unk> and work together to make better buildings , better cities , better cities , because there 's a lot of play .
Buildings are not just reflecting our society , local libraries , local libraries -- local libraries , local libraries , where we are going to make our children and the walk in the bathroom .
Thank you very much .
This is my niece , <unk> .
It just turned a year and started walking .
And it makes it that great , typical of children from a year , <unk> , as if his body was moving too fast for their legs .
It 's totally precious .
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at you in the mirror .
She really loves his reflection .
It <unk> and <unk> , and it gives itself these big , wet kisses .
It 's beautiful .
It apparently , apparently , all of your friends do this and my mother tells me that I used to do it . And I would think , `` When stopped doing this ?
How does n't we all taste our appearance ?
Because apparently , we do n't like it .
Every month , 10,000 people are looking at Google , `` Am I ugly ? ''
This is <unk> , it 's 13 years old and lives in Denver in Denver .
And as any teenager , it just wants to be loved and fit in .
It 's Sunday at night .
He 's preparing for next week in school .
It has a bit of fear , there 's a little bit of confused , because his mom tells him all the time , she 's a while beautiful , every day in school , someone says it 's ugly .
Between what his mom says , and what his friends or coworkers are told you , do n't know who believe .
So it 's a video of her same , publishes it on YouTube , and ask others that please leave a comment , `` Am I nice or ugly . ''
Well , so far , <unk> has received more than 13,000 comments .
Some of these things are so unpleasant , which is not even worth thinking about it .
We talk about a healthy teenager , normal and current , who receives these answers in one of the most stages of their life most vulnerable lives .
Thousands of people are having videos like this , in their most vast majority of teenagers trying to communicate this way .
But what is it going to do ?
Well , the teenagers are almost never alone .
They 're under pressure of being online , available all the time , talking , <unk> , <unk> , saying , commenting on , by saying , you know , you 've never done .
Never before we have been so connected , in a continuous way , so , so young .
As a mother said to me , `` It 's like a party in his fourth night . ''
There 's simply no privacy .
And the social pressures that go from the hand with that they are just true .
This environment , we 're going to be always connected to our kids to <unk> based on the number of `` I like that '' they have and the kinds of comments that they have .
There 's no division in online life and real life .
It 's really hard to know the differences between what it 's real or what it is .
And also , it 's very hard to know the difference between what it 's authentic and it 's kind of rigged that it 's rigged .
What is the greatest life in someone 's life in front of what is normal in a daily basis ?
And where are they looking for inspiration ?
Well , you can see the kind of images that are covers of the news of girls now .
<unk> size zero continue to dominate our <unk> .
The technique of <unk> is a routine .
And trends like : # <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
For those of you , <unk> means <unk> .
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today .
It 's not hard to see with the young people .
But the kids are also not immune to this .
It 's like the <unk> singers and <unk> singers .
But what is the problem with all of this ?
Well , we certainly want our kids to grow healthy , and they 're very <unk> individuals .
But in a culture obsessed with image , we 're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort their appearance , the price of all the other aspects of identity .
Things like their relationships , the development of their physical capabilities , their studies and other ways they start to suffer .
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they 're pretty nice enough .
These are not trivial activities .
They 're fundamental activities of growth as human beings and as a <unk> of <unk> society and the field of labor development .
31 percent , almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom are not interested in class issues , because they do n't want to call attention to their classroom , because they do n't want to call attention by their physical aspect .
One of five are not attending classes at all times during the days when they do n't feel comfortable in it .
And in the test test , if you do n't think you see you good enough , specifically if you do n't think you 're fine enough , you will do n't think you 're fine enough , you 'll get a lower note to the average of your fellow people who do n't care .
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland , United States and China .
And then regardless of what they actually weigh these young people in .
So , to be clear , we 're talking about it , not how you 're actually looking at it .
The low self-esteem on its body 's body .
And it 's also <unk> health .
The teenagers with time self-esteem do less physical activity , eat less <unk> , eat less fruit and vegetables participate in more diets , they can take them into food disorder .
They have low self-esteem .
They 're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at the greatest risk of depression .
And we think that 's all about what they 're making decisions more far-fetched , like alcohol and alcohol , diets , dramatic diets , aesthetic surgery , aesthetic relationships to early ages and no protection and damage , to <unk> .
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing into the health system , our government costs billions of dollars every year .
And we 're not controlling .
Women who believe that you 're overweight again , regardless of if you have no higher rates of waste .
17 percent of women do n't show a job interview in one day that they do n't feel safe with the way they see it .
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy .
If we could overcome this , what would that be that opportunity ?
You know , this potential potential for each of us .
But how do we do that ?
Well , by talking , by itself , does n't take a far away .
Not enough .
If you really want to change things , you have to do something .
And we 've learned that there are three key shapes : The first one is we need to instill in your own body .
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies for pressure of perfect images and building their self-esteem .
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it .
The bad news is that most n't work .
I was shocked very surprised when I learned that many well-meaning programs , without realizing that , make it worse .
So , we need to make sure that the program that our children follow , will not only have a positive impact , but also a lasting impact .
And research studies show that the best shows that are the best programs focus on six key areas . The first is the influence of family , friends and relationships .
So these six ways , these six aspects are crucial starting to give an education in the body self-esteem to work .
An education is fundamental , but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take the driver 's seat and be a better role model for women and girls in our own lives .
defy the status of the current status of them , and mentioned in our circles .
It 's not good good at the input of our politicians or the size of their breasts , or the size of their breasts , or the size of an Olympic athlete , depends on the fact that it 's not a big beauty .
We need to start judging the people so they are , not as they can see .
All of us can start by doing responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks .
We can praise people with people based on their effort and their actions and their actions .
And let me ask you : When was the last time you put a mirror in a mirror ?
In short , we have to work together as communities as governments , as governments and as governments , to change our own culture , so that our children will grow to be valuing the entire person , to be valuing individuals , diversity , inclusion to themselves .
We need to put people who are actually making the difference on a pedestal .
It 's going to make a difference in the real world , let 's make them out of the big screen , because we just create a different world .
A world where our children are free to become the better version of themselves , where the way they believe they are never seen to be the ones who are , or to get what they want in their lives to do .
Think what this can mean for someone in your lives .
Who 's in mind ?
Anyone ?
Your sister ?
Your daughter ?
At niece 's niece , his friend ?
Could it just be a woman who is at two seats away . What would it mean for her if it was liberated from that <unk> voice inside it , which haunts it was n't having long legs , thighs thinner , small feet , feet smaller ?
What would it mean for it if we would give you this , and we would expect your potential in that way ?
Right now , the obsession with our culture with images with images .
But let our children get the kids really .
I think that the way you see you are just a part of your identity , and the truth is that we love them , and what they do , and for how they make us feel .
<unk> the self-esteem in our schools of our schools .
Let 's change each of us , the way we talk to you , and we compare to other people .
And working together as a community , from small groups to governments , so that the small age of an age of today , will become a safe become agents of today , will become sure .
Let 's do it .
On November 5 of November , a guy named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan , killed by the rabbi called <unk> <unk> , the leader of the Defense <unk> <unk> .
<unk> initially was an innocent , but being in jail for other minor charges , in other minor charges , at company from others , started to plan attacks about 12 icons of New York , including tunnels , synagogues , and U.N. headquarters .
Luckily , those plans were <unk> by an FBI informant .
Sadly , the 1993 of 1993 in the World Trade Center in the World Trade Center , unable to prevent .
Later he was going to be convicted of his participation in that bombing .
<unk> <unk> is my father .
I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , in 1983 , being an Egyptian engineer , with a loving mother , teacher , elementary school , the two people did all of the way by giving me a happy kind of childhood , a happy childhood did .
Only when I was seven years old , our family started to change .
My father taught me a form of Islam that very few , even most Muslims , even most Muslims , even most Muslims .
In the experience , I saw that when people take time to interact , it does n't need a lot to get to wish for the same things in life .
However , in religion , however , in all of a human group , there 's always a tiny fraction of people who are so encouraged by their convictions that they think we have to use all the possible means that they 're going to use all the possible means that they all have to live as them .
A few months before of arrest , and he sat up with me and explained that in the last weekends of week , he and he explained that in the last weekend , he and some friends , had been going training on on Long Island .
He told me that I 'm going with the next day .
We got to the <unk> shot that , without knowing our group , was under the FBI .
When I got my father <unk> , my father helped me to hold the rifle up , and explained to me about 30 feet for about 30 feet .
That day , with the last bullet that shot I gave up the little orange of orange on the goal , to surprise all of all , especially me , especially of myself , especially of mine , all the target broke off .
My uncle went back to the others and said , `` <unk> <unk> . ''
From such a parent , maybe son .
Everybody , the comment had a lot of laughter , but only a few years later I understood that they were so funny .
You see it in me , the same level of destruction that my father could cause .
Those other people would be willing to put up with a <unk> are charged with 100 pounds of explosives pounds of the World Trade Center in the north department of the World Trade Center , causing an explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000 .
I admired those men .
I called them `` <unk> , '' which means uncle .
When I was 19 , I 've already moved back to me 20 times , and that instability during my childhood did not let me make a lot of friendships .
Every time I started feeling comfortable closely closely with someone already was a time to pack up and get another city .
As I was always the new face of the class was often a victim of <unk> .
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white , but going to be the new class of the kind , quiet and a juvenile , <unk> enough .
So most of the time he was going to spend at home reading books , watching TV or playing video games .
For these reasons not developed social skills , to speak , very gently , by growing <unk> , was not prepared for the real world .
I was raised was raised by the people , based on arbitrary indicators , like their race or their religion is raised .
So how could your eyes open up ?
One of the first experiences that they had tested in the early experiences of thinking , was during presidential elections .
And in a <unk> program where I was in the National Development Convention , in Philadelphia .
My group went out in the subject of juvenile violence . Like I 'd been a victim of <unk> almost my whole life was kind of passionate about my life , so I was a lot of passion .
The members of this group came from diverse backgrounds .
One day , at the end of the convention , I discovered that one of the kids who had actually friendship , was Jewish .
It took several days out of light , and I realized that there was no animosity between the two .
I had never had a Jewish friend , frankly , quite proud of I was able to beat up the barrier that all life had made of the barrier that my entire life had made to believe it was <unk> .
Another crucial moment , when I got a summer work when I got summer of summer , an amusement park .
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and culture , and that experience was fundamental in the development of my character .
The entire life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and , by extension , all gay people was really wrong .
By chance , I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there , in a show , and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics I 'd seen in life .
Having been a child bullied , I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others , but it was n't easy for me to treat nice people , exactly in the way , the way I 'd like to be treated .
For that sense , I could contrast the stereotypes that they had as a child stereotypes , the experience of the interaction in the interaction in real life .
I do n't know what that 's like being a homosexual , but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control .
And then the Daily Show came the Daily Show .
Every night , Jon Stewart made me be intellectually honest with my <unk> , and I helped me see that of the people 's race , religion or sexual orientation , my religion is nothing to do with character .
In many ways , he became my Latin figure at a moment that I was desperately afraid .
Sometimes , inspiration can come from the unexpected thing , and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father , extremist , was not in vain .
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking about , and she said to me , and she told me something that was in my heart forever , while he 's alive .
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless enough and said , `` I 'm tired of hate . ''
At that point , I realized at the time , how much negative negative it is needed to keep all that hatred in your interior .
My real name is not <unk> <unk> .
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life .
So why did I go out and put them in a possible risk ?
Well , it 's simple .
I 've done it because I hope that someone , someday , who you 're going to try to bring to violence , can you hear my story and understand that there 's a better way to understand that there 's a better way , that although I 'm going to get my story and understand that there 's a better way to get it . ''
On the contrary , I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and prejudice . ''
I do it by the victims of terrorism and terrorism with her loved pain and the terrible pain , and the losses that the terrorism has produced them in their lives .
For the victims of terrorism , talking , against meaningless acts of my father 's actions .
And with this simplicity here , I tell me that violence is not inherent an inherent religion or race , that children do n't have to follow the parents from their parents .
I 'm not my father .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Really .
Right now , there 's a film that is projected in your minds .
It 's an amazing film movie .
It 's in 3D , and it 's the sound <unk> of what you hear and you see right now , but that 's just the beginning .
Your film has scent , taste and texture .
It feels your body , your pain , hunger , your pleasure .
It has emotions , anger and happiness .
It has memories , as a moments of childhood moments that project in front of your eyes .
And it 's constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious mindset .
The heart of the film is you who experience everything in direct .
This film is your flow of consciousness , the subject of the experience of the mind and the world 's experience .
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being .
Each of us is conscious .
We all have an internal movie , you and you and you . ''
There is nothing that we know more directly .
At least , I know I have an awareness .
I do n't sure you 're aware of yourself .
Consciousness is also the reason for living .
If we 're not aware , nothing in our lives make sense or value .
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe .
Why are we conscious ?
Why do we have these internal movies ?
Why are n't we just robots that we 're getting to produce outcomes without experiencing the inner movie results .
Right now , no one knows the answers to those questions .
I suggest that to integrate consciousness into science , you need some radical ideas .
Some people say it 's impossible a science of consciousness .
Science , by nature , is objective .
Consciousness , by nature , is subjective .
So there can never be a science of consciousness .
Because in most of the 20th century , we would have that vision .
The psychology was objectively in the objectively behavioral behavior , but nobody mentioned the objectively brain .
Even 30 years ago , when TED started , there were very few scientific work of consciousness .
After , 20 years ago , it all began to change .
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penrose , they said , `` now is the moment for science to get consciousness . ''
And since then , there was a real shock , a flourishing of a scientific work about consciousness .
And this work was fantastic . It was great .
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment .
The center of consciousness in recent years of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of correlations , correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness .
We saw some of this kind of fantastic thing in the fantastic job that I put Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago .
We now understand much better , for example , the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feeling pain or feeling happy .
But this is still a leadership of correlations .
It 's not a science of explanations .
We know that these areas of brain areas are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences , but we do n't know why .
I 'd like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience work : some questions that we want to explain consciousness , the questions about what are the brain areas that we want to explain consciousness .
But in a sense , that 's the easy problems .
<unk> neuroscientists .
There 's actually no easy problems with consciousness .
Well not the real central mystery of this matter : why all physical stuff physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness ?
Why is a subjective internal movie ?
Right now , we can not understand .
And you can say , let 's give the neuroscience few years of neuroscience .
It 's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like the traffic jam , like hurricanes , like hurricanes , like life , and we 're going to find explanation as well .
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors , how they operate the traffic , how they breed , how they breed their hurricanes , how they breed them , they adapt , how they breed , they adapt and metabolizing living organisms , and they 're all questions about how living organisms .
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as an emerging phenomenon , how we walk , how we 're talking , how we 're talking about chess .
But when it comes to consciousness , the questions about behavior , the kind of easy problems .
But the hard problem , is the question of why is it that all behavior is accompanied by a subjective experience ?
And here is , the standard paradigm of the emergence , the standard paradigm of neuroscience does n't have a lot to say .
I 'm a real heart of heart .
I want a scientific theory of <unk> to work , for a long time , was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work .
But finally I came to the conclusion that that did n't work for systematic reason .
I think we 're going to tell us at this point .
We have a wonderful chain of wonderful , cool explanations , we used this chemistry , and the chemistry explains chemistry , biology explains part of psychology .
But consciousness does n't seem to fit into this scheme .
On the one hand , it 's a fact that we are conscious .
On the other hand , we do n't know how that idea to our scientific worldview .
I believe that consciousness , right now , it 's kind of anomaly , it 's something that we need to integrate our worldview , but we do n't know how .
With an anomaly like this , you can need radical ideas , and I think we need the ideas that at first look crazy , before you can deal with the awareness of a scientific way .
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas .
My friend Dan Dennett : It 's here today , has one .
His crazy idea is that there is not such a hard problem of consciousness .
And the whole idea of inner inner film includes sort of an illusion or confusion .
Actually , what you have to do , is to explain the objective functions , behaviors of the brain , the behaviors of the brain , and it 's studies of what it 's needed to do .
Well , more power for him .
That 's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness purely reductionist , based on the brain .
At the same time , for me and many others , that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness will be satisfying .
But I go in a different direction .
In the time , I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promising .
The first idea is that consciousness is critical .
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a fundamental building , the space , time and mass .
<unk> laws that govern them , like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics or quantum mechanics .
These laws and fundamental properties is not explaining in terms of anything more basic .
On the contrary , they are very fundamental , and it 's built the world .
Sometimes , the list of the fundamental thing is <unk> .
In the 19th century , we found that you ca n't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of fundamental concepts , space , time , mass Newton , of Newton , and then it applied the basic laws , and then applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept of concept .
I think that 's the situation we have with consciousness .
If you can not explain consciousness in terms of fundamental insights in terms of <unk> , space , time , a mass , time , a load , so , the logic of the list .
The most natural would be to run awareness as a fundamental thing , a fundamental brick of nature .
This does n't mean that suddenly not the object of science .
It opens the way to the scientifically operating path .
So what we need to do is study the fundamental laws , which govern consciousness , the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts of consciousness : space , time , time , mass processes , physical processes .
The physicists sometimes say that we want the fundamental laws we want to do so simple one of them in a <unk> .
The situation of consciousness is something like that .
We want to find very fundamental laws so simple that we can in a T-shirt .
We still do n't know what laws are , but that 's what we 're looking for .
The second idea is that consciousness can be universal .
Every system can have a degree of consciousness .
This vision is sometimes called <unk> : `` Pan , '' by everybody , `` <unk> , '' by mind , not only humans , the dogs , the <unk> , the <unk> , even the microbes of Rob Knight , the elementary particles , including flies , even the microbes of Rob Knight , Knight particles .
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness .
The idea is not that photons 'll be smart or thinking .
It 's not that a photon can be full of anguish , when you think , `` Oh , I always go traveling at the speed of light .
I never can slow down and smell the pink . ''
No , so .
But the thought is that maybe the photons can have some element of raw , subjective , some primitive precursor from consciousness .
This may sound a little crazy for you .
How do anyone think about something like crazy ?
And in part of this comes from the first crazy idea , which consciousness is a fundamental thing .
If it 's fundamental , like space , time and mass , is natural to assume that it can also be universal , just like the others .
It 's also worth noticing , that even though the idea seems to <unk> , it 's much less for people of different cultures , where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature .
One deeper reason , it comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest way and powerful , to find a fundamental reason to find fundamental laws that are <unk> with the information .
Whenever you have information processing , you have awareness .
Now , we 're going to be complex <unk> , like in a human being , complex consciousness .
So , millions of simple information , simple consciousness .
Something very exciting is that in recent years of a neuroscientist , a neuroscientist , <unk> , took this type of theory , and developed it rigorously with mathematical methods .
It has a mathematical measure of information about what 's called <unk> , which measures the level of information integrated into a system .
And I 'm supposed to do with consciousness .
So in a human brain , there 's an incredible degree high of information integration is a high degree of <unk> , a high degree of <unk> , a high grade brain .
In a mouse is a half a degree of integration integration is quite significant , degree of significant consciousness , very important degree .
But when you get the worms into the worms , microbes , particles , the degree of <unk> <unk> .
The level of integration integration is less but not zero .
In <unk> theory , there will still be a different level of zero awareness .
It actually offers a fundamental law of consciousness : high degree of <unk> , high degree of <unk> .
Also , another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world .
The physicists and philosophers have been observed that the physics is curiously abstract .
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations , but we do n't talk about the reality underlying it underneath .
As Stephen Hawking , `` Where 's the fire comes out of equations ? ''
From <unk> vision , the equations of physics , you can leave as you are , but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness .
That 's what physicists basically do , describe the flow of consciousness .
According to this vision , consciousness is what puts fire in the equations .
In that vision , consciousness does n't find out out of the physical world is out of the physical world .
It 's right there in the center .
And this vision , I think , <unk> vision , it has the potential to fix our relationship with nature , and have a pretty serious ethical and ethical implications .
Some can be <unk> .
I used to think that I should n't eat anything with consciousness , then I had to be a vegetarian .
If you 're a <unk> and you take that vision , you 'll get a lot of hunger .
I think about doing well , this is , it tends to transform your visions , while what matters in ethical terms and moral moral terms and this is its importance of consciousness .
It 's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems , like computers .
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie `` <unk> ? ''
Is it conscious ?
According to the vision of information <unk> , she has a complicated processing , integrated , so the answer is yes , if it 's conscious .
If this is right , you have some pretty serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of intelligent computers and the <unk> ethics .
Finally , you can ask for the whole awareness of whole collective , a whole planet .
Canada has your own consciousness ?
Or at a more local level , a local , integrated way , like the audience at a TED Talk -- this is an inner TED movie , an inner TED movie , an internal movie for this whole group of TED movies ?
I do n't know the answer to that question , but I think at least it 's a question that you should take seriously .
So this <unk> vision , it 's a radical vision , and I do n't know if it 's right .
I 'm actually safer from the first crazy idea , that consciousness is a fundamental thing that 's universal .
And the vision raises a lot of questions , many challenges , like , how those little bits of thought contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and we love .
If we can answer those questions , then I think we go through the right path to a theory of serious consciousness .
If no , well , it 's probably the hardest problem of science and the hardest problem of philosophy .
We ca n't wait to solve it overnight .
But I think we will finally find it out .
Understanding consciousness is the real key , I think , to understand the universe and to understand ourselves .
Maybe we just need the crazy idea .
Thank you .
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria .
I had a very normal profile , a low profile of education .
I went to school , I joined my friends with my younger sisters .
It was all very normal .
And when I was 15 years old , a member of my community came up to my parents , because I wanted to <unk> for a community reward .
And my parents said , `` Well , that 's very nice , but there 's an obvious problem .
She actually has n't achieved anything . '' And they were right .
I went to school , I went to school , and I had good grades . After school , I had a low profile in my mother 's hair , and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series , '' and `` <unk> 's Creek . ''
Yeah , I know . What contradiction .
But they were right .
I did anything anything that was extraordinary at all .
Nothing can be considered as an achievement if we take the disability out of the equation .
Years later , I was in the second part of school in Melbourne of Melbourne in Melbourne in Melbourne in Melbourne in Melbourne of only after about 20 minutes of <unk> , one guy raised the hand and said , `` Hey , when you will give you your speech ? ''
And I said , `` What do you talk ?
Well , I had been talking about the defamation law for good 20 minutes .
And he said , `` You know , you know , a motivational speech .
When people in chairs in wheels , do you talk about <unk> things in school ? ''
`` Usually in the classroom . ''
And that was then when I realized , this child had had experiences with disabilities as things as inspiration .
And we 're not . And it 's not the fault of the guy ; that is true for many of us .
For us , people with disabilities are not our teachers or our doctors or our doctors or our <unk> .
We 're not real people . We 're there to inspire them .
And , in fact , I 'm on this stage <unk> at what I 'm doing in this wheelchair , and you 're waiting to inspire them . Right ? Right ? Yeah .
Well , ladies and gentlemen , I 'm afraid .
I 'm not here for <unk> .
I 'm here to tell you that you have to lied relation to disability .
Yes , we 've been sold to the lie that disability is a bad thing , and to be a capital M .
It 's bad stuff and living with a disability makes you remarkable .
It 's not a bad thing and it does n't make fun .
And in the last few years , we 've been able to spread even more to lie with more social media media .
You may have seen images like this : `` The only disability in life is a bad attitude . ''
Or this one : `` Your excuse me is <unk> . ''
Or this one : `` Before abandon , '' you !
These are just a couple of examples , but there 's a huge amount of them .
You may have seen one of you , a little bit of my hands drawing with a pencil of the mouth .
You may have seen a kid who runs with artificial legs of carbon fiber .
And there are lots of these images , which are what we call porn inspiration .
And use the deliberately porn term , because we 're pushing a group of people out of another group of people .
So in this case , we would take the disabled people in the benefit of people .
The purpose of these images is to inspire , to motivate you , and think , `` Well , that 's really bad for my life , and think , `` Well , that 's really bad for my life , might be worse .
I could be that person . ''
But what if you are that person ?
I 've lost the number of times , I 've lost my mind number sometimes , to express that they think I am brave or a source of inspiration , and this would happen before my work was a public profile .
It was like me to wake up in the morning and I remember my own name , and this is <unk> .
These images , these images , those images to engage people with disabilities in people with no disability .
They 're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you , or to do their concerns in perspective .
And life as being disabled is really difficult .
Let me give you some things .
But the things we 've gone over is not the things that you can think of .
It 's not related to our bodies .
I use the term `` disabled people , '' deliberately because I 'm going to call it the social model of disability , that tells us that we are more disabled because of our bodies .
So I 've lived in this body for a long time .
I 'm very <unk> with him .
So , the things I need to do , and I 've learned how to pull out the best of its capacity , like you do , and that 's what happens to the children of those photos too .
They 're not doing anything out of the common .
They 're just using their bodies taking out the best of their capacity .
So , is it really just going to look at it in the way we do , by sharing those images ?
When people say , `` You 're a source of inspiration , '' say it 's like a compliment .
And I know why .
It 's because of the lie , because of the lie , that disability makes us remarkable .
And honestly , it does n't .
And I know what you 're thinking .
I 'm here with inspiration , and you think , `` For God , you 're not sometimes inspired by something ? ''
And I know I know it .
I 'm trying to other people with disabilities at all time .
However , I do n't learn that I 'm more lucky than them .
Now , I think that this is an amazing idea , and I 'm going to pick up the things that they fall on , and I would take the things that they fall on . I 'm going down , I choose the clever little trick of how long to get your battery battery on your phone phone battery in the chair . ''
Great .
We learn from the strength and the resistance of others , not against our bodies and our diagnostics , but against a world that <unk> .
I really think that we lie to lie about disability is the biggest injustice .
It makes us hard life .
And that quote : `` The only disability in life is a bad attitude , '' the reason that that 's a lie , it 's because of the social form of disabilities .
A lot of these smiles at a pile of suitcase has n't never made it become a ramp .
Never . <unk> on a television screen wo n't get the subtitles for the deaf people .
It 's also not a lot of people in a middle of a positive outlook , turning all those books into the braille outlook .
It 's just not going to happen .
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception , but the norm .
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl , sitting in his bedroom , watching `` <unk> the <unk> '' does n't consider nowhere to be in a chair .
I want to live in a world where we do n't have so low expectations of the people with disabilities that we 're <unk> up with with the bed for the morning .
I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement of people with disabilities , and I want to live in a world where a senior boy at the age of 11 grade in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user .
Disability does n't make remarkable , but to question what you think you 're thinking about .
Thank you .
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional football ?
And what is the average speed of a swallow <unk> ?
Unfortunately , it 's just going to answer one of those questions , so please do n't you know , please do n't go out .
When people think actually think augmented `` Minority Report , '' and I think in Tom Cruise and Tom Cruise <unk> hands in the air , but augmented reality is not science fiction .
Augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and it 's going to happen because we have the tools to do it , and people need to know , because augmented reality is to change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones .
So how do we get augmented reality ?
The first step is what I wear : Google Glass , Google Glass .
I 'm sure many of you are familiar with them .
What you may not know is that Google Glass as a device that lets them see what I see .
It will allow them to experience what is being a professional athlete .
Right now , the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk> .
I have to use words . ''
I have to create a framework .
We can use Google Glass , under a helmet and knowing what is running through the game field at 160 miles per hour , blood blood .
We can know that it feels that a man 110 pound <unk> , trying to get it out with everything its being .
I 've been there and I assure you it 's not nice .
Let me put a few videos to show what 's like Google Glass in the helmet , and give you an idea of that .
Unfortunately , they 're not images from the NFL , because the idea of the NFL is the idea of the emerging technology of the emerging technology , a submarine rising to the surface , but we do what we can .
So let 's look at a video .
Chris <unk> : Come on .
It 's horrible to be <unk> .
A moment . Let 's get a moment .
Why ?
Go !
Chris <unk> : As you can see , it 's a <unk> of what 's going to be <unk> in the football field , from the <unk> perspective .
You may have realized that there 's people , the rest of the team .
We have a video from the University of Washington .
<unk> <unk> : Mice 54 ! Mice 54 !
Blue 8 , Blue 8 ! Go !
Chris <unk> : This is a little bit more about the countryside , but has nothing to do with being in the NFL .
The fans want that experience .
The fans want to be in the field , being their favorite players , and they have asked me on YouTube and on Twitter , and I 've asked me on YouTube and on Twitter . ''
Or about a runner ?
We want to experience that . ''
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass , how do we go in the next level ? How do we get the next level ?
We took it to that level using something called the Rift Rift , which I 'm sure you know .
The Rift has been described as the most realistic reality device ever created , and it 's not cheap <unk> .
And I 'll show you why , with this video .
Man : Oh , oh , oh !
No , no ! No ! I do n't want to play out ! No ! ''
Oh , my God ! Ah !
CK : That 's the experience of a man on a roller coaster basis for his life .
What 's going to be the experience of a fan of Adrian when you put a movie of Adrian Adrian crossing the line , throwing it off the line , <unk> with the arm , before you run up and make an notation ?
And then , when you can be <unk> running through the court , getting the ball to the bottom of the network ? Or let me do you with a Wimbledon end ?
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles like a Olympic skier ?
Maybe they would get their sales sales 's sales for adults .
But this is not even augmented reality .
It 's just virtual reality , <unk> .
How do we reach augmented reality , <unk> ?
Let the augmented reality when coaches and coaching coaches and owners see the information that people want to see and think of , `` How do we use this to improve our teams ? ''
How do we use the games ? ''
Because they always use the technology to win .
They like to win . Give them money .
So , here 's a quick refresher on technology in the NFL .
In 1965 , the Baltimore <unk> , they put a <unk> on his field to play up faster .
They won the Super Bowl that one year .
Other teams decided we 're actually decided .
More people saw the party because it was more exciting , faster .
In 1994 , the NFL , the NFL , the NFL sticks on the field <unk> and after in the defenses .
They had more viewers , more viewers , because it was more quickly .
In <unk> , imagine , you 're a player coming back to your group and you see your next little show shown in you in you , in a plastic bombsight that you have put . You do n't have to worry about it in front of you , in a plastic bombsight .
It 's about to memorize the strategy .
They just go out in the countryside and react .
And the coaches want it , because if they do n't follow their instructions , they 're losing games , and they hate games .
If you lose games as a coach you do .
And they do n't want that .
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk> manual manual .
Augmented reality is also a way to collect gathering information and use it in real time to improve your game .
How would you do it ?
Well , a very simple option would be to have a camera at every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down .
You also get information from the helmets sensors and <unk> , something you 're already working on .
And all of that information is sent to your players .
The good teams will know it .
Bad people will have information overload .
This is <unk> to good teams of bad guys .
So , your computer team is going to be as important as your scouts and analysis data will stop being just nerds .
It will also be for athletes , who would have imagined ? Who would have imagined ?
How would it be in the field ?
Imagine that they are the field <unk> .
You get the ball and <unk> it .
It would take a open receptor . Suddenly , a flashlight on the left side of your <unk> bombsight is going to tell you that a defense behind you are going to <unk> the <unk> behind you .
Let 's go into the protection area .
Another flashlight you get , there 's an open receiver .
You 're going to get the ball down , but you 'll get it down .
And the ball loses the trajectory .
You do n't know where land , yet , the receptor sees in its bombsight , an area of grass that lights , and it can change the race .
He comes up the ball and run the ball and give it up .
The public public <unk> and fans have the play run from every angle .
This is something that will create a massive emotion .
So I 'm going to make lots of people see , because people want to live that experience .
The fans want to be in the countryside .
They want to be their favorite player .
Virtual reality will be part of sport because it 's too profitable not to be .
But what I 'm going to ask you is , do we want this one use is the only use of augmented reality from reality ?
Are we going to use it just as bread and circus , like our habitual entertainment ?
Because I think we can use it for something else .
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings , to show someone how it is , literally , to be anywhere else .
We know what this technology is worth buying into their sneakers .
It generates billions of revenue per year .
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show up how harmful actions are the actions of the victim of the victim ?
How much is this technology technology for a gay person in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives is being pursued ?
So how much is it worth that a Hadfield piece , or an Neil <unk> saving trying to inspire a generation of children to get out of the space and the science rather than <unk> notes and <unk> ?
Ladies and gentlemen , reality augmented reality .
The questions we do , the choices we take and the challenges that we face , they depend , as usual , as usual .
Thank you .
Recently , I was retired after 23 years of <unk> in California .
Most of those 23 years to me , the most <unk> country , the end of <unk> County , which includes the Golden Gate Bridge .
And the bridge is an iconic structure , we know by its beautiful view of San Francisco , the Pacific Ocean , and its inspirational style of architectural style .
Unfortunately , it 's also a magnet for suicide , being one of the most used places in the world .
The Golden Gate bridge was open in 1937 .
Joseph Strauss , an engineer head , patient to build the bridge , said that , `` The bridge is pretty much for suicide .
suicide since the bridge is not practical and likely . ''
But from 1600 , more of 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge from that bridge .
Some of you think they travel between the two towers taking to another dimension , this bridge has been idealized as such as it , such as it releases you from all your concerns and the waters that the waters that they go underneath your soul .
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide .
After a drop of four to five seconds , the body hits water for water about 120 miles per hour , the body hits in water .
It breaks the bones the bones , some of which are <unk> organs .
Most people die in the impact .
Those who do n't normally , they 're going to be helpless in the water and then they suffocate .
I do n't think that , I think , you know , the suicide method will notice the death method they 'll be going to .
This is the wire .
Except about the two towers , there are 32 inches of parallel to the bridge .
Here 's where most people get before they get their life apart .
I can tell you from experience that once the person is on that edge , and in the darker moment , it 's very difficult to bring them back .
I took this picture last year while he was talking with an officer looking at her life .
I want to tell you how we were glad that day to bring that day to bring it back on the railing .
When I started working on the bridge , we had no formal training .
<unk> to channel the path through these calls .
This was not just a bad service for those who were losing the suicide , but the officers too .
We 've come a long way since then .
Today , officials and veterans are trained to the new officers .
This is Jason <unk> .
I met this July 22 last year by receiving a call from a potential suicide granted at the center line .
<unk> , and when I came , I looked at Jason talking to Jason talking with an official Golden Gate Bridge .
Jason was only 32 years old , and he had flown up until here from New Jersey .
In fact , he had actually flown up until two times before in New Jersey to try and commit suicide from this bridge .
After about an hour after about an hour by talking to Jason , I was asked if we knew the history of Pandora 's box story .
He <unk> the Greek mythology , <unk> created at Pandora , and he sent the Earth with a box , and he said , `` He said , `` never open that box . ''
Well , a day , curiosity could get more than Pandora , and she opened the box .
From her she got pests , sorrows , all kinds of evils against man .
The only good thing in the box was the one good thing .
So Jason , then Jason , asked , `` What if you open the box and there 's no hope ? ''
He stopped a few points , he leaned on the right , and it was . ''
This kind of smart guy and intelligent guy from New Jersey had just taken up with life .
I talked to the parents of Jason that night , and I guess when I was talking to them , it did n't look like it , and I guess when I was talking to them , it did n't seem like it very well , because the next day , the rabbi 's rabbi called to see how he was .
The parents of Jason had been asked them .
The damage damage about suicide affect a lot of people .
I asked them these questions : What would you do if a member of your family , a parent or someone else was suicidal suicide ?
What would you say ?
What would you say ?
In my experience , it 's not just to talk , but you have to listen .
Listening to understanding .
No <unk> , <unk> , or tell the person you know how it feels , because you probably do n't know .
Just being there , you can be the tipping point you need .
If you think someone is suicidal , you 're not afraid and ask yourself .
One way to ask you the question is : `` Others in similar circumstances have thought about your life -- you 've had these thoughts ? You 've had these thoughts ? ''
<unk> the person in front of you can save her life and be the tipping point for them .
Other signs seek out : despair , to believe that things are terrible , and they 're never going to improve ; they 'll believe it 's not anything you can do about it , and they 're thinking about recent social isolation , and a loss of interest in life .
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago , and I got an email from a lady , and I 'd like to read your letter .
She lost her son on 19th of this year , and he wrote this email a couple of days a couple of days ago , and it 's about his permission and blessing I read that I read .
`` Hi , Kevin . I imagine you 're at the TED conference .
It must be a whole experience .
I 'm thinking that should go on the bridge this weekend .
I just wanted to leave you a note .
I hope you can tell a lot of people , and go home talking about it to your friends and tell your friends to tell your friends to tell your friends and so on . ''
I 'm still quite numb , but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike really wo n't go home .
Mike was driving out from San Francisco to see the match by his father was the 19th of 49 .
He never got there .
I called the police police and has reported as they disappeared , that night .
The next morning , two officers came to my house and reported that the car of Mike was below the <unk> car was below the bridge .
A witness had to jump a witness to the <unk> of the evening in the evening .
Thank you very much for fighting for those who be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves .
Who has n't been before not having a real mental illness without suffering from a real mental illness ?
It should n't be so easy to end with it .
My prayers are with with you for your fight .
The <unk> Bridge , the Golden Gate Bridge that 's supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay , not a cemetery .
Good luck this week , <unk> . ''
I ca n't imagine the value that she needed to go and go to the bridge that his son took that day , and also the courage to go forward .
I 'd like to introduce you to a man that I 'm talking with hope and value .
On March 11 of March 2005 , I said to a radio call by a radio suicide on the sidewalk on the north line .
I led my motorbike riding on the sidewalk and looked at this man , Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk .
When he looked at me , the tail immediately crossed , and stopped in that little tube , he stopped in that little tube around the tower .
For the next half , I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and hopelessness .
And Kevin decided on her that day back to that lane and give life another opportunity .
When Kevin came back , it 's <unk> .
`` This is a new beginning , new life . ''
But I asked him , `` What was it that he made up in and gave the hope and another opportunity ? ''
And you know what ?
He said , `` I 've heard that .
They stopped me talking and just heard . ''
Shortly after that incident , I got a letter from Kevin , and I have that letter with me , and I 'd like to make it .
`` Dear Mr. <unk> , I did n't erase the events on the March 11 , and you 're one of the reasons that Kevin on us .
I really think Kevin was <unk> for help .
It 's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been correctly right .
I brought it to Kevin when I only had six months , completely unconscious of all the traits , completely unconscious of all of those traits , but because of God , we now know .
Kevin is in order Kevin .
We thank God by yourself .
<unk> with you , <unk> <unk> . ''
And at the end she writes , `` <unk> . When I visited San Francisco Hospital , that night , you 're going on , you 're going on as the patient .
`` Wow , I had to solve it . ''
Today , Kevin is a loving father and a <unk> of society .
It talks openly about the events of that day and his depression about the hope that his story will inspire others .
suicide is not just something that I 've been found in work .
It 's personal .
My grandfather committed himself with poison .
That act , despite finishing his own own pain , theft to me .
This is what suicide does .
For most people who consider suicide , or those who consider suicide , they would n't think of someone else .
They just want their own pain to end up .
Usually , this is only achieved only three ways : sleep , drugs or alcohol or alcohol or death .
In my career , I 've responded and I 've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls suicide around the bridge .
From those incidents where I 've been directly involved , I 've only lost two , but those two are too much .
One was Jason .
The other man he was talking about about an hour .
During that time , I was holding my hand on three occasions .
At the end of it , I looked at me , and said , `` Kevin , but I have to go . ''
And he jumped .
Awful , absolutely horrible .
I want to tell you , though , that the vast majority of people we get to contact on that bridge do n't kill it .
In addition , those few who have actually jumped from the bridge and lived , and you can talk about it , that one percent , most of those people have said that the railing they leave , the railing realized they had made a mistake , and they wanted to have a mistake they 'd made out that they 'd made a mistake and want to live .
I tell people , the bridge is not just connected to San Francisco , but also people .
That connection , or bridge that we make , is something that everyone and every one of us must have to work to do .
suicide can be preventing .
There 's help . There is hope .
Thank you very much .
The world makes you become what you 're not , but you know what you are , and a question you 're going : How are you going to become that ?
I have to be something unique in that sense , but I 'm not alone , no way alone .
When I became a model , I felt that eventually I had achieved the dream that I had since a child .
My outside , finally , <unk> with my inner truth with my inner self .
For complicated reasons , I 'm going to go over my way later , I think , `` Did you get a picture done , you 've got it , you know , you got it up . ''
But last October , I discovered that I 'm just starting .
All of us would tell our families , our religion , our society , our moment in history , even our bodies .
Some people have the value of free free , to get rid of the limitations of the skin color or the beliefs of us .
These are people who are always defy the status quo , which is considered accepted .
In my case , the last nine years , many of my neighbors , many of my neighbors , my agent , even ignored my story .
I think this puzzle is called revelation .
This is mine .
I was recorded as a kid at birth , because of the appearance of my genitals .
I remember my five years in the Philippines of my age in my house , I was always wearing this shirt on my head .
And my mom asked me , `` Why is you going , `` Why do you just wearing that shirt on your head ? ''
I said , `` Mom , my hair is my hair . I 'm a girl . ''
I knew then how <unk> .
The gender has always considered a unchanging , but we now know that it 's something more complex and mysterious .
Because of my success , I 'm never going to tell you my story , because I think that 's going to be bad , because I think it 's bad , but it 's about how the world is about us .
Every day I appreciate being a woman .
I have a mom , dad , and my family accept me as I am . ''
Many are not so lucky .
There 's a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender .
There 's a Buddhist goddess of compassion .
There is a Hindu goddess , goddess of <unk> .
And when I was eight years old , I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries .
I was in front of the stage , and I remember that beautiful woman came up with me , and I remember that moment as if something happened to me : This is the kind of woman I 'd remember .
And when I was 15 years old , when I was wearing a man , I met this woman named <unk> .
It 's the principal of a transgender beauty competition .
That night , she asked me , `` Why do n't you have a beauty competition ? ''
He told me that if she was losing it over the firewall , she said to me , and the costumes that night , and that night , I won a <unk> suit , and I won a third <unk> suit between the 40 candidates is over 40 and became third of 40 candidates .
That moment changed my life .
Suddenly , I was within the world of beauty of beauty .
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was the beauty of beauty of women , but I can .
I also met the goddess of people , especially when we traveled to remote provinces of the Philippines .
But more important than that , I met my best friends in that community .
In 2001 , my mom , who had moved to San Francisco , and he called me and told me they passed my green card request that I could go to live to the United States .
I was resistant .
I told my mother , `` Mommy , I 'm amused .
I 'm here with friends , I like to travel and be a queen of beauty . ''
But then , two weeks later , I called and said , `` You know that if you read the United States , you can change your name , you can change your name and your gender identity ? ''
It was all I needed to hear .
My mom suggested I was two `` and '' to my mom .
She also accompanied me when I had accompanied me when she was 19 .
It 's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand to do the most sophisticated , sophisticated surgeries , sophisticated and secure .
At that time in the United States , it was necessary to do the surgery before the name and gender .
So in 2001 , I went to San Francisco , and I remember looking at driving license with the name `` F '' with the name `` F . ''
It was a great moment .
For some people , their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a drink , but to me it was the license for me to live , to feel dignified .
Suddenly my fears saw was <unk> .
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York , and to be model .
Many are not so lucky .
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A young woman in New York City who was living his truth , but that , <unk> , did end his life .
For many of my community , that 's the reality they live in .
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population .
And all the 20 of November we make a global vigil <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
I 'm on this stage thanks to a long story about a long history , and I 'm standing in front of injustice .
These are Marsha W. Johnson and Sylvia <unk> .
Today , right now , I 'm coming out of the closet .
I ca n't keep my mind living alone and just for me .
I want to make the best people live their truth without shame , fear .
I 'm here , you know , <unk> , so that there 's no longer <unk> on 20 of November .
My deeper truth took to accept what I am .
You will .
Thank you very much .
Thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you . Kathryn Schulz : <unk> , a quick question .
<unk> <unk> : Sure . You see with all my blessings .
My support network , especially my parents , who are very strong .
I remember every time I remember trans young trans women , and sometimes I 've called me and tell me that when they called me and told me their parents were going to tell me , I would take the phone , called my mom , and said , `` Mommy , you can call this woman ? ''
Sometimes it worked , other times not . It 's gender identity , that 's what 's at the center of what we are , right ?
I mean , everybody was assigned a gender to be born , and what I 'm trying to do is put it on the table that sometimes sometimes have this block , and there should be a space that would be allowed to <unk> people , and this is a conversation we would have with colleagues .
The transgender movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement .
There 's still a lot of work to do .
There should be understanding .
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions , and I hope that all of you are my allies .
KS : Thank you . Sweeney : Thank you .
In many of a lot of patriarchal and tribal societies , the parents are usually met by their children who are usually known for their daughter , but I 'm one of the very few parents who are known for his daughter , and I 'm proud of that .
<unk> started his campaign by defending their rights in 2007 , and when they ran away their efforts in 2011 , by <unk> the <unk> , was made very famous , a very popular girl in his country .
Before that , I was my daughter , but now I 'm his father .
Ladies and gentlemen , if you take a look at the history of humanity , the story of women is the history of injustice , of inequality , of inequality and for exploitation .
You see , in patriarchal societies , in patriarchal right from the beginning , when at birth when you 're born , your birth is not offered .
It 's not welcome , not by his father or his father .
The neighborhood comes , it gives her mother and no mother <unk> .
And a mother drives a lot of a child .
When he gives birth to the first child , the first child , he gets sad .
When he gives birth to the second child , he was <unk> , and , with the hope of a son , when he shines his third daughter , feels guilty as a criminal .
Not only the mother suffers , it 's the newly born child , when she grows , also suffers .
At the age of five , when you should go to school , you have to go home , sit at home , sit down at school .
Until the age of 12 , in some way , has a good life .
You can have fun .
He can play with his friends on the street , and he can move through the streets like a butterfly .
But when you go into a teenager , when you go in the adolescence 13 years of his house without a male companion .
It 's confined to the four walls in their house .
It 's not a free person .
It becomes called the honor of his father and his siblings and his family , and if he <unk> the code of that honor , honor could even kill the code .
And it 's interesting that this idea of honor , it 's not only affecting a life of a girl 's life , it also affects the life of male family family .
So this brother , <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of their sisters in the name of honor .
And there is a more norm norm about patriarchal , which is called compliance .
A good girl should be very quiet , very humble very humble and very <unk> .
It 's the criteria .
The model of a good girl model must be <unk> .
It 's supposed to be silent and accepted your father 's decisions and your mother and the decisions of the elderly , even if you do n't want .
If you marry them with a man who do n't like that , or if they marry them with an old man , it does have to embrace it , because it does n't want to be used <unk> .
If a young marry , young people , have to embrace it .
Otherwise , <unk> <unk> .
And what happens in the end ?
In the words of a poet `` <unk> , <unk> , and then gives birth to children and daughters . ''
And the irony of the situation is that this mother , <unk> the same lesson from compliance to his daughter , and the same lesson of honor .
And this vicious cycle goes continues and continues .
<unk> brothers and sisters , when they were born , and for the first time they were born , and for the first time , trust me , I do n't like newborns , I do n't like newborns in there , to be honest , but when I was there and looked at me , believe me , I was n't really honored .
And much before I was born , I thought about his name , and was fascinated with a feisty fascinated by freedom in Afghanistan .
His name was <unk> of <unk> , and I called my daughter like this .
But when I looked out , they were all men , and he grabbed my pen , and I took a line from my name , and I wrote , `` <unk> . ''
And when she grew up , when she was four and a half , and when she was growing up in my school .
You might ask , why do I have to mention a child from a school kid ?
Yes , I have mentioned .
You can give it for granted in the United States , in the United States , in many developed countries , but in the poor countries , in patriarchal societies , in tribal societies , that 's great event for a life of a child 's life .
<unk> in a school means recognition of your identity and your name is recognition of your identity and your name does it .
One to school , it means that it 's in the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore its potential life for their future life .
I 've got five sisters , and none of them could go to school , and they 'd be surprised out of the Canadian school form , when I was in the Canadian part , in the Canadian part , and I was in the relative part to the family , I could n't remember some of my sisters .
And the reason was that I 've never seen the names of my sisters writing in any document .
That was why that 's courage to my daughter .
What my father could not give my sisters to my sisters to thought to her , I thought I had to change it .
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter .
I 'm going to sit down with me when my friends came to see me when my friends came to see me .
The encouraged to go to different meetings .
And all of these values , I 've tried to <unk> in his personality .
And this was n't just for her , just to <unk> .
I 've happened all of these good values in my school to girls and girls and boys .
I used education for a emancipation .
I taught my daughters , I taught students , to forget the lesson of the obedience .
I taught students to forget the lesson from the so-called <unk> .
He <unk> brothers and sisters , fighting for more rights for women , and we fought them to have more and more space for women in society .
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon .
It was lethal for human rights for human rights , and in particular , for women 's rights .
It was called <unk> .
That means a complete denial of women 's participation in all of the political and economic activities are social and social .
Hundreds of schools .
girls are banned off to school .
Women were forced them to use a <unk> and stopped going to the women .
The musicians were silenced , young girls and singers and singers .
<unk> millions , but few few of them talked about , and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and kill them when you talk about their rights .
It 's really frightening .
By the 10 years , <unk> , and he got up the right to education .
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC 's blog , he was offered herself for the New York Times documentary , and he spoke on every platform that he could .
And his voice was the most powerful voice .
It became <unk> like <unk> around the world .
And that was why the Taliban could n't tolerate his campaign and October nine of 2012 from October 2012 .
It was a day <unk> for my family and me .
The world became a big black hole .
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between my life and death , and I whispered her ear on my wife , `` I have to blame my wife for what happened to my daughter , to your daughter ? ''
And he said to me , he said , `` Please do n't tell you .
It 's the fair cause .
<unk> your life in play for the cause of truth , because of the peace cause , and by the cause of education , and your daughter was inspired by you and got together .
Both of them were on the right path and God will protect it . ''
And these few words , I 'm a lot of <unk> , and I did n't ask myself again .
When I was in the hospital , I was in the hospital , and I had severe pain headaches , because his facial nerve was cut , and I used to see a dark shadow that was signed by the face of my wife 's face .
But my daughter never complained .
I used to tell you , `` I 'm fine with my skewed smile and the <unk> in my face . ''
I 'll get it right . Please do n't worry . ''
It was a comfort for us , and it was <unk> .
<unk> brothers and sisters , we 've learned from her how to resist in the hardest moments , and I 'm happy , to share with you , that , despite being an icon for the rights of children 's rights and women are like any girl 's rights icon , and women , as any girl 's rights icon .
He crying when she has n't got her homework .
They fight with her siblings , and I 'm very happy about that .
People ask me , `` What 's special about my mentoring that have made it so audacious and so audacious so bold and so brave and <unk> ? ''
I do n't say what I did .
I did what I did .
I did n't cut his wings , and that 's all .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago , and since that day , the science of the brain has become a personal passion .
I 'm engineering .
And I want to tell you that recently I 've joined the <unk> group , and I want to tell you , where I 've had a ride to my office visualization -- I 've got a visualization for my Google <unk> visualization , but the whole work I 've been talking about today on science about the brain , I did before I join Google or outside my work
Having said this , there is a stigma when you 're headed to a brain operation .
Do you do it as smart or not ?
If you 're not going to be able to get smart ?
And after neurosurgery , I was missing a part of the brain , and I had to live with it .
It was n't gray matter , but it was the dead sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and neurotransmitters .
Immediately after the operation , I had to decide how much more than about a dozen powerful chemicals every day , because if I did n't take anything , they would die in a few hours .
Every day , for the last 18 years , I 've had to decide about the combinations and mix it up , and you mix them in chemicals , and try to get a hold of your own life .
I have more than once again .
But luckily , I have a soul <unk> , so I decided that I would try to get the dosage dose of the <unk> dose that really does n't have a clear map that he says it in <unk> .
I started to try with a different mix , and I was stunned by looking at how small changes in the doses are changed dramatically my <unk> , my sense of who I was , my way of thinking , my way of thinking , my behavior with others .
A particularly impressive case : for a few months , for a few months , I tried a dose of standard , 20 , and I was surprised to see how my thoughts changed my thoughts changed .
I was always angry , I thought I was thinking about all the time in sex , and I thought I was the smartest person around the world , and -- of course , many times in the past , I 've met several guys like this , or maybe some versions of them .
It turned out as it turned out .
But my great surprise was that it was not trying to be arrogant .
In fact , I was trying a bit , a lot , fix a problem that I had in front of it , and just not happen .
So I could n't run a handle .
I changed my dosage .
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and what they have to go through . Since then , I 'm getting better with men .
What I 'm trying to do is adjust my own hormones and neurotransmitters and so on , it was to reclaim my intelligence after the disease and surgery -- my creative thinking , my creative flow , after the disease .
I used to think almost always in images , and that became my key reference point , how to make those mental images that I use to create <unk> , my ideas , if you want it ?
This kind of is not new thinking .
<unk> like Hume , Descartes and Hobbes , look at things similarly .
They thought images and mental ideas were the same thing .
Now , there are people who challenge this idea , and there are a lot of discussions about how minds the mind work . For me , it 's simple : for most of us , mental images are fundamental to <unk> and inventive .
So after several years , I 'm finding the point right , and I have a lot of a lot already , and I 've got lots of great mental <unk> , really pollute , very sophisticated and very <unk> .
Now , I 'm working on how fast these mental images are mental images from my mind to the computer screen .
Can you imagine what would happen if a filmmaker could be able to use your imagination just to steer the world around ?
Or if a musician could get the music of your head ?
There are incredible possibilities of this , like the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light .
And the truth is that , the only difficulty to achieve this is simply increase the resolution of our brain systems .
Let me show you why I think we 're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments made up by two recent groups made in neuroscience .
Both of both use MRI technology , image by functional MRI MRI , to represent the brain , you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard .
The column is showing the scan of the brain from a person looking at a picture .
The column shows the scan of the brain of that individual 's brain as I imagined , looking at that same image .
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column of the left , and you see the difference is almost random .
This is actually <unk> in many different individuals with many different images , with many different images .
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost a bit of random .
Now , let me share with you another experiment . This is the lab in Jack <unk> in Berkeley , California .
They managed to turn the brain waves in visual fields fields .
Let 's put it in .
In this experiment , he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos , while they 're <unk> their brains to create a great set of reactions from the brain in the brain sequences of video footage .
And then , I showed you a film with new images , new people , new animals , new animals , and as so much , we would have a new scan .
The computer , using just the brain information of scanning the scanning of scanning <unk> to show what seemed like the person I was seeing .
On the right you can see the trail of the computer , and on the left , the video that showed you .
This blew us away .
We 're very close close to doing that .
We just need to improve resolution .
And now remember that when you see an image and when you imagine that same image , the same mapping the same mapping itself .
This was done with the brain scanning systems of the largest resolution systems available today , and its resolution has been a thousand times over the last few years .
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look at the way .
How did we do it ?
There 's lots of techniques to do that .
One is opening the skull and introduce electrodes .
I 'm not offering that .
A lot of people are proposing new projection techniques , for images , even me with the recent outcome of MRI results , we need to ask the next thing , this technology will be the end of the path ?
The conventional wisdom is that the only way to get bigger resolution is to be with larger magnets , but at this point , more <unk> , only are only providing small improvements in resolution , not gains for thousands of improvements .
I propose this idea : instead of larger magnets , we make better magnets .
We can create a lot more complex structures with slightly different , like making a <unk> .
And why does this matter ?
In the last few years , a lot of an <unk> amount of effort in MRI were all in the MRI , right ?
However , most of the recent advances in recent <unk> solutions of ingenious solutions and bright and bright receptors in coding and <unk> and FM transmitters and FM transmitters .
Instead , instead of a uniform magnetic field , use <unk> magnetic patterns , embryonic <unk> magnetic patterns combined .
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns at the patterns of processing radio processing patterns from FM processing and FM processing that can rise to a single scan .
In addition , we can then divide our growing growing of layers structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need .
By using the fMRI , we should be able to measure not just the blood of blood blood , but the hormones and <unk> that I 've mentioned , and perhaps even the activity of direct neural neural activity .
We 're going to be able to push our ideas directly into digital media .
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through the thought through ?
What would we be able to ?
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of the human thinking without filter them ?
You thought the Internet is big something .
These are big questions .
It would be so compelling use as a tool for amplify our thinking skills and communication .
Certainly , this one tool could lead to the Alzheimer 's disease and diseases like that .
We have a few options more to open up this door .
But anyway , choose a year to happen in five or 15 years ?
It 's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more .
We need to learn how to give this step together .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk to you this night about out , not just in a traditional traditional , not just of the gay closet .
I think we all have closets we have .
Her closet probably is to tell someone for the first time for the first time he loves it or tell someone who is pregnant , or telling someone who has pregnant , or telling someone who has to be pregnant , or to tell someone who has to cancer , or any other hard conversation that you 've gone through in life .
Every closet is a tough conversation , and even though our issues can vary tremendously , the experience of living , and having come out of that experience .
It 's fear , and we do n't like it , and it must happen .
Many years ago , many years ago , I was working in the South Side -- a restaurant in the city , and being there , had to go through various phases of the intensity 's intensity -- <unk> : I did n't get my armpits , to quote from <unk> .
And I 'm going to be slope from my breath in my short pitch , and I 've got my head <unk> , I 'd just ask myself , usually , by a little kid , `` Hey , I 'd normally ask a little boy , `` Hey , you 're a kid ? ''
And he would have a uncomfortable silence on the table .
I 'll get my jaw a little bit more , I would take my coffee with a leave of anger .
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother launched a cold look at his son .
But I would n't say anything , and let me go through it .
And I came to the point that every time was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old , I was ready to fight .
And that 's terrible feeling .
So I promised myself that the next time would say something .
It would have that hard conversation .
So after a few weeks after a few weeks , again .
`` You 're a boy or a girl ? ''
A family silence , but this time I was about to get into the female 's issues at the table . He had the dates of Betty <unk> .
Gloria Steinem quote .
Even a piece of the `` Vagina Monologues , '' I would show .
And so I take a deep breath , and I went down to my backs on my back a four-year-old kid with a pink dress , look at me what 's not a challenge for a feminist duel , just a kid with a question : `` You 're a boy ? ''
So I took breath it took my breath back , and I was like , `` Hey , I know this is something confusing . ''
I have the short hair like a guy from a kid , and I 'm seeing a kid 's clothes , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I 'm a little girl dress , you know , you know , I 'm a little girl , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you
Well , I 'm more than kind of a girl in a <unk> match . ''
And that girl looked at me at staring at me , and he said , `` My favorite pajama is purple and has a fish .
Can you give me a <unk> , please ? ''
And that was . Just `` Oh , when when you 're crying .
What about <unk> I asked ? ''
It was the easier conversation of all I ever had .
And why ? Because the girl of <unk> and I , both loved one with the other .
So as many of us , I have lived in some cabinets in my life , and yes , often , my walls used to be a rainbow .
But within the dark , you can not know how color walls are .
You only know how one feels like living in a closet .
It 's like my closet not different from yours or yours or yours .
Surely , I 'm going to give you a 100 reasons why out of my closet , was more difficult to come out of your own , but this is the thing : How do it be hard .
The hard thing is hard .
Who can tell me that explain to somebody who have declared to broken it out , is more difficult to say it 's been fooled ?
Who can tell me that this story is more difficult to tell your son of five years that are going to get divorced ?
There 's no more difficult , it 's only hard .
We need to stop classify what 's hard for us to do with something that 's hard for us to make us feel better or worse to make us feel better or worse in relation to our closets .
At some point in our lives , we all live up on closets , and you can make security , and you can make security , or less security than the other thing offers .
But I 'm here to tell you , that no matter what your walls are made , a closet not a place to live .
Thank you . Imagine yourself 20 years ago .
I , who had a horse tail , a dress and <unk> shoes .
I was n't a militant lesbian -- I was n't a militant lesbian kid who would fit the coffee .
I was frozen by fear , <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> , and I was moving only a muscle to be the most scary thing that I ever have ever done .
My family , my friends , complete strangers that I 've spent my life trying to do n't disappoint , and now the world was turned around .
I was burning the pages of a script that we 've all had , but if you do n't spears that grenade , kill you .
One of my most memorable dug , was in my sister 's wedding wedding .
It was the first time that many among the guests knew that I was gay , and I was doing a lady in honor or honor 's job of honor , and in my black dress and I walked around the tables of honor , and I finally came up with the tables and I finally came back to one where the friends of my parents were , people who
And after talking a moment , one of the women shouted , `` I love Nathan Lane ! ''
And the gay story was starting .
`` <unk> , ever were you ? ''
`` Well , yeah , we have friends in San Francisco . ''
`` Well , we 've never gone there , but we 've heard that 's fabulous . ''
`` <unk> , you know my <unk> , you know ? ''
It 's very good and it has never talked about having girlfriend . ''
`` <unk> , what 's your favorite TV show ? ''
Our favorite program ? Will Grace and Grace Will Grace and Grace ? Will Grace ''
And you know who we love , Jack .
Jack is our favorite . ''
And then a woman , I wonder , and then I 'm looking desperately talking to her support , to get me out that I was on my side , finally said , `` Well , sometimes my husband 's wearing pink shirt , `` Well , sometimes my husband 's wearing pink shirts with pink shirt . ''
And I had an opportunity at that time , like all the launchers of grenades .
Surely , it might have been easy to indicate where they felt .
It 's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk> .
And what else can you ask for someone , but do you know ?
If you 're authentic to be authentic with someone , you have to be prepared for what 's authentic you get .
It 's like that , like the hard conversations are still still my strong point .
Ask about anyone who I ever come out .
But I 'm getting better , and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the <unk> .
Now , please see this through gay perspective through the gay perspective , it 's essentially the same .
Number one : Be real .
Turn your armor . Be it yourself .
That girl in the coffee I did n't have armor , but I was ready for battle .
If you want someone to be genuine , others have to know that we also suffer .
Number two : Be direct . Just <unk> .
If you know they 're gay , you know .
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay , they would maintain the hope that that could change it .
Do n't give you a false sense .
And number three , and more important -- let 's complex complex .
You communicate your truth .
I would never be aware of that .
And some of them can be injured secure , <unk> by what they 've done , but I never 'm sorry .
And yes , maybe you 'll feel disappointed , but that 's something in them , not you .
Those are expectations about what you are , but not their own .
That 's the story of them , but not from you .
The only story that matters is that you want to write .
So the next time you find out in a dark round by a grenade , you have to know that we 've all been there before .
And you might feel very lonely , but they 're not .
Thank you , Boulder . Enjoy the evening .
And , what is that ?
If you look at the history of how intelligence has been seen , an productive example has been the famous <unk> quote that , `` The question of whether a machine might think about it is as interesting as a question of whether an underwater can swim in , as a question of whether an underwater can swim in . ''
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computer pioneers as Alan Turing wrote .
And so , a few years ago , I took a program to try to understand the very fundamental physical mechanisms underlying the key physical mechanisms underlying the intelligence underlying physical mechanisms .
Take a step back .
Let 's start with a mental experiment .
Imagine that they are from an alien race to not know anything about the Earth 's Earth or the neuroscience of Earth 's Earth 's Earth has no intelligence of Earth , but have incredible telescopes on Earth , and so you can see the Earth during millions of years .
And you see a very strange effect .
Of course , as Earthlings , we know that the reason would be that we 're trying to save ourselves .
We 're trying to avoid an impact .
But if you 're from an alien race of an alien of this , that does n't have any concept about Earth 's intelligence , they would be forced to develop a physical theory to explain how , to some point in time , asteroids going on the surface of a planet that would take the surface of a planet 's surface to stop doing it .
And so I claim that this is the same question that we will understand the physical nature of intelligence .
So in this program that it took several years ago , I looked at a variety of issues across science , across various disciplines , who pointed , I think , towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence .
In cosmology , for example , there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be fixed by development of intelligence , and in particular , for the development of universal states and the development of universal states .
Finally , in the robotic movement planning , there 's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots skills to maximize complex freedom of action in the robots skills .
And so , taking all these different different issues and put them together , and I asked them for a number in years , there 's an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different issues ?
Is there just an equation for intelligence ?
And I think the answer is yes , what you 're looking at is probably the closest equivalent of an E = <unk> <unk> for intelligence that I 've seen .
So what you 're looking at here is a statement that intelligence is a force that intelligence is a force , F freedom of action .
It 's acting to maximize the future freedom of action , or keep the open options , with a force T , with the diversity of <unk> future , accessible to a future time diversity , accessible .
In a nutshell , intelligence does n't like a little stuck .
The intelligence tries to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain open choice .
And so , by having this equation , it 's natural to ask : what can you do with this ?
So what such thing is ?
Did you find the human intelligence level ?
Would artificial intelligence ?
So I 'm going to show you now a video that I think , show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation .
Narrator : <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that make produce more disorder , or `` entropy , '' for their life they should be tendency to trend in conditions like we 're going to .
But what if that cosmological <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is a deeper relationship ?
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of long-term entropy production , but actually arises directly from it ?
To find out , we 've developed a software engine called <unk> , called <unk> , designed to maximize production of long-term entropy .
Remarkably , <unk> could pass multiple animal tests , play a game of human intelligence , and even make money by trade by actions , all of it without being told by doing that .
Here are some examples of <unk> in action .
Just like a human standing on <unk> , here we see balancing automatically automatically on a pole using a cart .
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave a goal .
He just decided on his post to balance .
This ability for balance applications will have applications for humanoid robotics and technologies of human assistance .
This ability for tools is going to be applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture manufacturing .
Also , just like some other animals can cooperate by pulling aside from opposite ends from a rope at the same time to release the food , here we see it can have a version of that model model that 's a task model .
Now , this ability of cooperation has some interesting implications for economic planning , and in a variety of other fields .
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of domains .
For example , here we are successfully playing a game of somebody 's operating game against itself , it 's their potential potential for play .
Here we can see Saudi orchestrate new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly being out and keeps it in successfully the connected network .
This sort of <unk> capacity also has applications in health care for health , energy and intelligence .
Here we see <unk> organize the routes of a ships , discovering success and using the Panama Canal , and using the Canal Canal the Panama Canal the routes and the Pacific Canal .
In the same way , <unk> is widely applicable in problems and logistics , logistics and transportation .
Finally , here we 're going to be able to spontaneously discover and run a strategy of <unk> , <unk> in a simulated series of actions negotiation , successfully increasing assets in their exponentially form .
This risk management skill will have vast applications for finance and secure .
Alex <unk> : What you 've seen is that a variety of smart cognitive behaviors of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tools , walking upright , and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation to maximize their future freedom of action behavior .
Now , here 's a deep irony here .
Let 's go back at the beginning of the use of the term , the play `` <unk> '' -- there was always the concept that if you 're going <unk> smart machines , there would have a cyber rebellion .
The machines stand against us .
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades , we 've had the whole concept of rebellion in the reverse .
It 's not that machines first become intelligent and then encouraging , and to try to take over the world .
It 's all the opposite , that the urge to take control of all possible futures is a more fundamental principle that intelligence can actually come directly from taking control of the control , rather than being the way backwards .
Another important consequence is the pursuit of goal .
I often ask myself : How do you look for goals of this kind of framework ?
My equivalent of that statement to that statement to go to the descendants to build artificial building artificial intelligence or to understand human intelligence is the next : intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the freedom of action and avoid the constraints in its own future .
Thank you very much .
We 're at a tipping point in human history , something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet we call home .
Although , in the last few years , we 've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how Earth fits the context in the context of the universe .
The Kepler mission has been discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars , what points that Earth is only one among the billions of planets .
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the tenuous light intensity of stars when planets go ahead and blocking a little bit of that light .
The data picked by Kepler shows the sizes of planets showing up the length of the planets and their mother .
And together , we 're helping us to understand whether these planets are little and reliable like planets like Earth Earth , and also the amount of light that 's getting out of their solar system .
Instead , this gives you clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not .
Unfortunately , as we 're finding this treasure treasure of that potentially habitable , our own planet 's own weight of humanity .
2014 year was the hottest record .
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for us for millennia now are now disappearing , they 're now disappearing .
These environmental changes that we have made global scale have rapidly surpassed our capacity to alter their course .
But I 'm not a scientist scientist , but an astronomer .
But we study the <unk> of the planet by influenced by the world , with the hope of finding places in the universe where we see beyond our planet .
You could say , I 'm looking for alien opportunities in the housing sector .
Now , as someone really interested in the search of life in the universe I can tell you , the more I look for Earth-like planets similar to Earth , more enjoy our own planet .
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better : our solar system .
Let 's take our neighbor , Mars .
Mars is small and <unk> , and in spite of being a little bit of a little bit of a world , that might be a potentially habitable world to be shown by a mission like the Kepler .
In fact , it 's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past , and in part , it 's why we study so much on Mars .
Our <unk> as the `` Curiosity '' track its surface in search of clues about life 's origins , and as we know it .
The satellites that , like the <unk> mission , taking samples from the atmosphere of Mars , and they try to understand how Mars has an atmosphere of Mars .
Now , private companies now offer not just space flights , but also the ability to live in Mars .
But despite the fact that all of these <unk> images remind us of our planet , places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> , compared to the Earth , Mars is a pretty awful place to live .
Let 's take the extension of our planetary areas of our planet , that we still have to colonize , actually , in comparison , places with Mars .
Even in the most dry place on the Earth is fresh , filled with oxygen , filled with oxygen , for our tropical forests to thousands of miles away .
I 'm worried that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other feet will get a big and sad shadow -- the implication , and the belief that we have Mars to wait for us to save out of this <unk> self-destruction of the single planet of the single planet to know that it 's truly livable , the Earth .
For a lot of that , I like <unk> exploration with this idea .
There are lots of good reasons to go to Mars , but to say that Mars is going to be there for humanity , is like to imagine the captain of the Titanic , and that 's how to imagine the captain of the Titanic will have more late in the life boats . Thank you .
But the targets for exploration and land exploration and land is not behaving .
No , they 're actually faces of the same coin : the goal of understanding , preserve and improve life in the future .
The extreme environments here in our world looks like alien <unk> .
You just find out closer .
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces , habitable spaces , in the hostile and sides of the land , maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that .
I 'll leave you with a mental experiment : the paradox of Fermi .
Many years ago , many years ago Fermi said , `` having to realize that our universe has been around for a long time has been around for a long time , and we expect that there were many planets in this universe of life , we should have found evidence of extraterrestrial life so far .
Well , where are you ?
Well , a possible solution to Fermi is that when civilizations is that , when civilizations are advanced , technologically advanced enough to consider the notion of the stars , they lose the notion of how important that is to protect the planets from this development .
It 's kind of arrogant to think that only we have to save ourselves , but the planetary preservation and exploration of us , but the planetary preservation and exploration of us .
If we really believe in our ability to deal with the hostile environments of Mars for human presence of Mars for human presence , so we should be able to overcome the <unk> .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I 'm going .
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets , I realized I had no keys .
In fact , I could see the window who were at the table where he had left them .
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors , to open up all the other doors .
I thought to call a <unk> , at least I had my cellphone , but at midnight , a <unk> <unk> might take a long time to get it , and it was cold .
I could n't go back home from Jeff 's friend 's home , I could n't go back at night , and I had an early flight to Europe next morning , and I could n't go back in my passport , and my suitcase . ''
<unk> expensive , but it 's sure that not more expensive than a <unk> at night , so I thought , despite the circumstances , despite the living room , OK .
I 'm a neurologist 's neuroscientist , and I know a little bit about how the brain is working under the brain .
It releases cortisol that increases your heart rate , <unk> levels of adrenaline .
And when I got to the <unk> counter at the airport , I realized I had no passport .
Well , I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep .
And I started to wonder , if there was something that I could do , systems that could be able to put in place , which could be preventing bad things happen .
Or at least , if bad things happen , that will be the chance that it 's a total catastrophe , a total catastrophe going to be there .
So I set up to think about that , but even a month later , and then my thoughts do n't forget .
I was having dinner with my colleague , Danny <unk> , a bit embarrassed Nobel Prize winner and a bit embarrassed about him , talked about my passport , and I had forgotten my passport , and Danny shared with Danny shared with something called a <unk> <unk> .
It 's something that he had learned from psychologist Gary Klein , who had written out of this a few years before , also known as well as <unk> .
Everybody knows what the <unk> is .
Every time there is a disaster , a team of experts come from and tries to figure out what went wrong , right ?
In the <unk> , as he explains Danny , you look forward and you look forward and try and figure out all the things that they could go wrong and then try to figure out what they could get out wrong , and then it 's trying to figure out what they could do to prevent it from the things happen or to minimize the damage .
So what I want to talk about with you is a few things that we can do in the form of a <unk> .
Some of them are evident , other people are not so evident .
I 'm going with the obvious thing .
In the house , you would take a place for things that are easily lost .
That sounds common and it 's , but there 's a lot of science supporting this thesis , that thesis on how our space memory works .
There 's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , which has evolved over thousands of years , to take track of the location of the important thing , where the fish are important , which are located the trees , where they live tribes .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that were <unk> in London .
It 's the part of the brain that allows the squirrels to find nuts .
And if someone really did the experiment , they cut the sense of <unk> , they cut the sense of rows and still they could find their nuts .
They did n't use smell , but the hippocampus , that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things .
But it 's really good for things that they do n't move a lot about , not so good for things they 're going to move .
This is the reason for losing keys of the car and the goggles and passports .
So in <unk> , a place for the keys for the keys on the door , maybe a decorative dish , maybe a hunger dish .
For her passport , a particular crate .
For his eye glasses , a particular table .
If you take a place and you 're <unk> with it , you 'll always look for it .
What about the journeys ?
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit cards , license , license , passport , <unk> yourself so that you 're in the cloud .
If these things are lose or steal , this can facilitate substitution .
These are some of the most obvious things .
Remember , when you 're under stress , your brain releases cortisol .
cortisol is toxic by cortisol .
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress , will be at the best time , and you have to put the systems on your site .
And there 's maybe no more stressful situation , where you face a medical decision .
And at some point , we 're all going to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical health care or a loved one , to help you with a decision .
And so I want to talk about that .
And talking about a very particular medical condition .
But this is going to be a <unk> for all decision-making for medical decision-making , and in fact for the financial decisions and social decisions have to take a kind of rational evaluation of the facts .
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says , `` I 've received the result of the lab and the cholesterol result . ''
Everybody knows that high school is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease , attack heart disease , stroke .
So , you 're thinking about having high cholesterol is not the best , then the doctor says , `` I 'd want to give you a drug that will help you reduce your cholesterol , <unk> , <unk> . ''
And maybe you 've heard about the <unk> , and you know it 's one of the most thoughtful drugs that you are in the world today , even you are likely to know that you take them up .
So you 're thinking , `` Yes , you 're <unk> <unk> ! ''
But there 's a question that you have to do , then , a statistic you should have to ask that most doctors do n't want to talk , companies , pharmaceutical companies even less .
It 's for <unk> , the number you need to treat .
And what is this , <unk> ?
It 's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have a surgery on any medical procedure ever helps a person .
And you should think of what kind of <unk> statistic is that ?
Number one must be one .
My doctor would n't hurt me something if they were not to help me .
But actually , medical practice does n't work like this .
And it 's not the fault of the doctor , and if it 's someone 's fault , scientists like me .
We have n't understood very well the underlying mechanisms .
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs is only only 30 to 50 percent of people .
So the number you need to deal with the most widely set of <unk> , what do you think it is ?
How many people have to take it before you can help your person help ?
300 .
This according to the research of the <unk> Survey , and Pamela <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
myself explored the numbers .
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack , stroke or another event .
Now you might think , `` Well , one probability will 300 on your cholesterol . ''
Why not , doctor ? <unk> the recipe anyway . ''
But then you 've got to ask for a bit of a statistician , and it 's `` <unk> of the side . '' Right ?
For this particular drug , the side effects produce five percent of patients in this particular way .
And those include terrible things : muscle pain , muscle and articulate , GI pain , but now you think , `` Five percent is not really likely to happen to me , still taking the medicine . ''
But a moment .
So remember , you do n't think with clarity .
So , think about how we 're doing this with time , so they do n't have to make the chain of reasoning .
300 people are taking the drug , not ? A person has helped , five percent of the 300 can have side effects , that are 15 people .
You have 15 times more likely to get harmed because of the drug that you can help you out the drug .
I do n't say they should be <unk> .
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor .
And the medical ethic is , is part of the beginning of informed consent .
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not .
So maybe you 're thinking that I 've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash , but actually this number you need to treat it quite typical .
For the surgery that is the most done in the older men , the number of 50 , <unk> prostate cancer , the number required of 49 .
So this is , 49 surgeries by one person who has helped them .
And the side effects in that case , they 're produced by 50 percent of patients .
Those include helplessness or erectile disfunction , urinary incontinence , urinary incontinence of urinary , the fecal incontinence include greatness .
And if you 're lucky enough , it 's one of that 50 percent effects , only one year or two .
So the idea of <unk> is to think before , the questions that you can make up that <unk> conversation .
You do n't have why to make all of this .
And you also want to think about quality of life .
Because of you , you have a choice often , you want a shorter life of pain , or a longer life of pain that could have a lot of pain at the end ?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now , with their family and their loved ones now , with their loved family and their loved ones now .
You can change your mind at the heat of the moment , but at least you 're trained in this kind of thought .
Remember , our brain releases cortisol , and one of the things that 's happening at the time is that they turn out a lot of systems .
There 's an evolutionary reason for this .
Face 2 Face with a predator <unk> with a predator , does n't need the digestive system necessary or digestive system or immune system , because if the body is spending on the metabolism on those things , it wo n't react very quickly . You might be able to get the lions on the lions in those things .
Unfortunately , one of the things that you 're going through the window during those moments of stress is rational , rational , like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown .
So we have to train ourselves to think about the future kinds of situations .
I think what 's important here is to recognize that we are all failing .
We 're all going to fail every time .
The idea is to think about the future , how they could be those failures , to put the systems in the place that will help it to minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things happen in the first place .
I went back to the snow night in Montreal , when I came back from my journey , my contractor and I came back from my journey , and in a combination of combination with the combination of the combination in the same way , an easy way to remember it .
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of cards that I have n't ordered , and lots of emails that I have I read .
So I 'm not very organized , but I see the organization as a gradual process , and I 'm doing it .
Thank you very much .
Interpreter : <unk> , `` <unk> '' is my favorite musical symbol .
It means playing .
If you 're playing a musical instrument and you see a `` <unk> '' on the score , you need to touch more softly .
Two , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
Four . <unk> <unk> .
This is my picture drawing of a <unk> tree , you see it does n't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may have , never mind a whole thousand , complete silence .
That 's my definition today of silence : a very dark sound .
I 'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American signs of signs , the <unk> , besides a little bit of my own own story .
The language of French signs came over the decade of 1800 , and over time walks , mixed with local signs , and developed the language that we already know as a <unk> .
So , it has a story about 200 years .
I was born deaf . And I was taught that sound was not a part of my life .
And I thought that was true .
And yet , I realize it 's not true for anything .
<unk> are a very important part of my life every day .
As a person who lives in a world of sounds , it 's like , if I lived in a foreign country , after blindly , to blindly their rules , customs , behaviors and norms and the norms are <unk> .
So how do I understand the sound ?
Well , I see how people behave and respond to sound .
People are like my speakers and amplify sound .
So I learn , and I 'm looking at that behavior .
At the same time , I 've learned that I can create sounds , and I 've seen how people respond .
So , for example ...
`` No <unk> the door ! ''
Do n't make a lot of noise by eating the potato chips ! ''
`` No <unk> , and when you 're eating , make sure you do n't scratch them off the dish make it . ''
This is all I call this sound tag .
Maybe I think of sound label more than the average person does it .
I 'm super <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm always hoping with nervousness , the sound , which is coming to come next .
From there , this drawing .
<unk> , to decide it .
<unk> it , to keep going .
<unk> , <unk> .
You can see that <unk> does n't have notes on the lines .
That 's because the lines already contain sounds by subtle <unk> and spots .
In the culture , the movement is equivalent to sound .
This is the signal for <unk> .
A typical <unk> has five lines .
However , for me to do whatever with my thumb , so you do n't feel natural .
That 's why in my drawings , I just have four lines on the paper .
In 2008 , I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin , Germany , for an artistic residence up there .
Before this time , I had worked like <unk> .
During this summer , I went across museums and different galleries , and while I was going from one place to another , I realized that there was no visual art there .
At that point , the sound was the trend and struck me .
There was no visual art , everything was hearing .
Now the sound has entered my art territory .
Is it going to cause me more than art ?
I realized that does n't have this way .
In fact , I know sound .
I know it so well that not only experience through your ears .
I can feel it 's a tactile form , or it experience visually , or even as an idea .
So , I decided to reclaim the sound , and I decided to reclaim artistic practice .
And everything they had taught me about the sound , and I decided to leave it out .
I started to create a new body of work .
And when I presented it to the artistic community , I was shocked with the amount of support and attention that I got .
I realized that sound like money , power , power , social , social currency .
In the background of my mind , I always felt that sound was alien , it was a listener person .
And the sound so powerful that it might be good at me that well , my artistic work , or I could empower it .
I chose to <unk> .
There is a mass culture around language .
And just because I do n't use my literal voice to communicate , the eyes of society is like no voice at all .
So I have to work with people who can be supported me as well and become my voice .
That way I am able to be relevant in society today .
So in school , in work and institutions , work with many different performers of <unk> .
And his voice becomes my voice and identity .
They help me be heard .
And their voices and weight value .
Ironically , by asking <unk> their voices of value , I 'm able to keep a temporary form of interest by taking a loan with a high interest rate with a loan in a high interest rate in a loan with a very high interest loan with a loan with a very high interest loan to take a loan with a loan with very high interest .
If you would not continue with this practice , I feel that you might be happy on oblivion and not have any kind of social value .
So with sound like my new artistic medium , <unk> in the world of music .
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between the music and the <unk> .
For example , a musical note ca n't be catching and express in paper .
And the same thing can be said from a <unk> concept .
The two are highly spatial and highly correlated , meaning that means subtle changes can affect all the signals so forth .
I 'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano , to understand how <unk> works .
So , imagine a piano .
<unk> divided into lots of different <unk> parameters .
If you can spread a different parameter for each finger as you get the piano , like facial expression , your body movement , the body form , speed , form of hand and like the piano , is a linear language , a linear language .
However , <unk> is more like a chord , you need the 10 fingers simultaneously to express a sense of of course , or then to express a sense of of course .
If only one key would change the chord , it would create a completely different meaning .
The same thing happens with music as a tone of music , timbre and volume .
In <unk> , when you use these different <unk> parameters , you can express , different ideas .
For example , the <unk> .
This is the <unk> .
I 'm seeing you .
<unk> stare .
Oh , I 'm <unk> .
Uh oh .
What are you looking at ?
Ah , good !
So I started thinking , and if I see the <unk> through the music lenses ?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and again , it might be like a piece of visual music .
For example , this is the sign of `` day , '' the sun comes out and it puts .
This is `` all day . ''
If you 're <unk> and <unk> speed , visually looks like a piece of music .
All day .
I feel like the same thing , `` All night . ''
All night .
This is all night , in this drawing .
And this led me to think about three different types of nights , `` Last night , '' `` Last night , '' `` overnight , '' `` all night . ''
I feel that third has more <unk> than the other two .
This represents how time express in <unk> and how long the body can express changes in time .
For example , a <unk> hand is a hand , two hands . It 's two hands , the present gets closer and closer and in front of the body , the future is in front of the body , the future is on the back .
So , the first example is `` a long time ago . ''
Then , `` Last . '' `` <unk> , '' and the last one , which is my favorite and dramatic idea at once , `` There was once . ''
`` Common Time is a musical term with a <unk> rate of four times by shaking .
However , when I see the word `` common time , '' I think automatically in the same time .
Watch <unk> : your right hand is my left hand .
We 've got <unk> through your head and your chest .
[ Face : <unk> : <unk> , holy limb ] [ unclear ] [ In your chest , I 'm going to show you a way of the hand , I 'm going to teach a form of the hand , I 'm going to show you a way of the hand .
Can you do it with me ?
All hands on high hands .
Now we 're going to do it both in the head like the chest , something like a common time , or `` at the same time . ''
Yeah , very well .
That means in the international system in the international system .
The international system , as a note , is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world .
The second I 'd like to show you is this . Please do it with me again .
And now .
It means colonization .
Now , the third . Please follow me follow again .
And again .
It 's `` illumination '' in <unk> .
We 're going to do the three together .
`` <unk> , '' `` colonization , '' and `` lighting . ''
Good job .
Notice how the three signs look very similar , they all occur in their head and their chest , but they convey very different meanings .
It 's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and thriving , like music .
However , today , we live in a very <unk> world .
And just because the <unk> has no sounds , automatically has no social value .
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the institution to develop its own value , no sounds .
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society .
And maybe people will understand that you do n't have to be deaf to learn <unk> , and we do n't have to hear about it to learn music .
<unk> is a treasure trove rich , and I 'd like you to have the same experience .
I 'd like to invite you open your ears , open your eyes , engage in our culture and experience of our visual language .
And you never know , can you in love with you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : Hey , that 's me .
As a child , my parents would say , `` You can <unk> everything , but then you have to clean it up . ''
Freedom involves responsibility .
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places , where everything was possible .
So I grew up in an innocence bubble , I have to say , because the adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrific truth .
By getting older , I found out that adults also , and they 're not very good at cleaning the other people from others .
Time country , now I 'm an adult , and teach citizenship and invention in Hong Kong .
You do n't expect so much for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of garbage .
So as good citizens , clean the beaches , and no , you 're not drinking alcohol , and if it 's , I did n't know it .
It 's sad to say , but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic .
It 's scary .
And in the last few decades , we 've been leaving these big ships and networks , and we 've been getting these pieces of plastic to them in the microscope , and we classify them and classify this information into a map .
But it lasts for eternity and it 's very expensive , and it 's also very risky to use these huge boats .
So along with my students , with ages from six to 15 , we dream , to make a better way .
We 've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop .
We started building this table with <unk> <unk> , so that children are also able to be able to participate .
And I 'll tell you , the kids who use electrical tools feel great and secure .
Not exactly .
Let 's go back into plastic .
We collect plastic and we cut it down the size of the ocean , which is very small , because of its fragmentation , it 's very small because of its fragmentation .
We do .
I leave it with my students ' imagination .
My job is to try and take the best ideas out of every child and try to figure out what we expect to work .
So we decided that instead of collect plastic pieces , just give you a little bit of information .
So by using a robot , we take a picture of this plastic -- the kids get a lot of a lot of this plastic with the robots .
And then we just created what we call `` a prototype . ''
We 're so fast in creating prototypes that we end up before of lunch .
And then we turned into a web and web cameras on accessories , and we put it into a floating robot that is slowly moving through the water and the plastic that we have there , and this is the picture captured by the robot .
We see the pieces of plastic floating down slowly through the sensor , while the computer computer process process , this image the size of each particle , to get an estimate of how much of the particle .
It took this invention step at a website for inventors called `` <unk> , '' with hope that someone will improve it even more .
So the great thing about this project , the students saw a local problem , and , boom , they 're trying to fix it right now .
I can research my local problem , but my students in Hong Kong are very nicely informed .
You see the news , you get it on the Internet , and you get them into this image .
A child , maybe less than 10 years old , cleaning an oil spill , only using hands , the largest mangrove forest in the world in Bangladesh .
They were really surprised because this is the water to drink , it 's the water where they bathe , the water where they live , the water where they live .
You can also see that the water is brown , the mud and oil and oil and oil , are also brown brown , and when it 's mixed up , it 's very hard to see what 's in the water .
But there 's a simple technology called <unk> , which allows you to see what 's in the water .
So , we built a first prototype of a sketch that you can burn through all kinds of substances that produce different spectra , which can help identify what 's in the water .
And we had this prototype prototype with a sensor and sent it to Bangladesh .
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local local problem , or to look at a local problem , my students use their empathy problem , my students used their empathy and the sense of creativity to the remote children .
And I 'm forced by a problem at a distance , I was forced to do a second experiment , and I wanted to go a little bit further , maybe address a more difficult problem , maybe to address a more difficult problem , maybe to address a more difficult problem , maybe to go close to me .
I 'm half Japanese and a half French , and you may remember , that in 2011 , there was a devastating earthquake in Japan .
It was so violent that it was about , and it was so violent calls , and those tsunamis stations tsunamis at the coast of Japan .
More than 14,000 people died in a moment .
It also gives day nuclear power plant , a nuclear power plant near the water .
And today , as a <unk> average reports are still leaking leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean .
Today , the entire Pacific Ocean has traces out of <unk> pollution .
If we go to the West coast , we can measure the radiation in Fukushima , we can measure the radiation in Fukushima everywhere .
But if you look at the map , it seems that most radiation of the Japanese coast disappeared from the Japanese coast , and most of the time , it 's blue , it 's blue .
Well , reality is a little bit more complicated than that .
I 've come back in Fukushima every year from the crash way independently with other scientists , the land , the river , and this time , we wanted to bring children .
Of course , we did n't have , the parents were not allowed .
But every night we report to the control center -- you see the use of different masks .
It might seem like they did n't have a serious job , but they did it because they 're going to have to live with their entire entire lives .
Along with them with them , we talked to them that day and we talk about what we were going to do next , and the strategies , the design , and so on .
And to do this , we created a <unk> <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant .
We created the elevation map , we introduced pigments to represent data in real time of radioactivity , <unk> water .
So , we were able to notice that the radioactive dust dust curve from the top of the mountain into the system <unk> and <unk> in the ocean .
It was a neat estimate .
But based on this is a civil expedition , the nearest nuclear expedition to the date .
And we zoom in up to the five miles of nuclear power , and with the fishermen , we were collecting the <unk> of the sea , with a tracker tracker to be collecting from the sea floor with a tracking tracker tracker as well as we invent and build .
Here we see a progression : we 've gone from a local problem to a remote problem , a global problem .
And it 's been very exciting working on these different scales , and it 's very simple R technologies and very simple source technologies .
But at the same time , it has been increasingly frustrating because we 've only been starting to measure the damage we 've done .
We have n't even started trying to solve problems .
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to make all of these things .
So the classroom turned a little bit so small , and we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong , and we became the largest dedicated space to impact social and environmental impact .
It 's at the center of Hong Kong , and it 's a place where we can work with wood , metal , chemistry , a little bit of optical biology , so you can build almost all over there .
It 's also a place where adults , and kids can play together .
It 's a place where the dreams of kids can become reality with adults , and where adults can be children again .
Students : acceleration ! <unk> !
<unk> <unk> : We asked things like : can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy ?
For example .
Or , we can help in the mobility of the elderly , transforming their standard wheelchair chairs in new electric vehicles ?
Plastic , the oil and <unk> are terrible enough , but the worst legacy we can leave for our kids are .
We ca n't afford to protect the terrible truth , because we need their imagination to invent solutions .
So , scientists , creators , <unk> , we have to prepare the next generation for the environment , and people , and so that you can really do something about it .
Thank you .
Two twin domes , two cultures of radically radically different backgrounds .
One is made from thousands of steel pieces of steel silk , the other one silk thread of silk .
One of them is synthetic , the other organic .
One puts over the environment , it creates it .
One is designed by nature , the other people .
Miguel angel , when he looked at the raw marble on it , he saw a shape that will be free .
The <unk> was unique to Michelangelo .
But living beings are not <unk> .
They grow .
And in the smallest units of life , the cells , we took all the information it would take for each cell to work , and to replicate it .
The tools also have consequences .
At least from the Industrial Revolution , the world of design has been dominated by rigors of manufacturing , the design world has been dominated by manufacturing .
The assembly lines have dictated a world that has actually dictated the imagination of designers and trained architects to think their objects like <unk> of discrete parts of different functions .
But you do n't find any <unk> material in nature .
Think of human skin , for example .
Our facial skins are thin <unk> pores .
The skins fur on the back are thicker with small pores .
You act mainly as a filter , the other primarily like a barrier , and yet it 's the same skin itself : there is no parts of it .
It 's a system that changes gradually its functionality through elasticity <unk> .
Here 's a split screen that represents my view of the world 's view , the <unk> personality of every designer and architect to work in between the <unk> and an architect and the organism , between the machine and the growth , between the machine and the organism , between Henry Ford , and growth , between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin and Charles Darwin .
These two visions of the world , my left hemisphere and the right analysis , is shown in both screens after me .
My work , at its simplest level , tries to bring these two visions of the world , moving away from the assembly .
You 'll probably ask yourself : Why now ?
Why was n't it possible that it 's about 10 or five years ago ?
We live in a very special moment in history , a weird moment where four disciplines that offers access to tools that offers access to tools that we have never had access from access to before .
And at the intersection of these four fields , my team and I create .
Please know , meet the minds and my students ' hands .
We design objects , products , and tools and tools and tools through scales , like this robotic arm , like this robotic arm with a scope of 24 meters in diameter at a order of 24 feet that one day not too far print entire buildings .
Here we have <unk> the latticework on the old Arab architecture , and it has created a screen where every opening is only to model the form of light and only through it .
In our next project , we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a skirt thing -- this was for a fashion parade of Paris to <unk> <unk> -- it 's like a second skin made from one single piece , <unk> , <unk> , flexible around the waist around the waist .
Along with 3D printing with <unk> 3D printing , we printed this this layer and skirt skirt between the cells , and I 'm going to show you more objects like that .
This is <unk> , rigid materials rigid and soft materials at the resolution of 20 microns .
This is the resolution of a human hair .
It 's also the resolution of an <unk> scanner .
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical analytical and the synthetic instruments , it enables not just the way to our bodies , but also the physiological structure of our tissues .
We 've also designed an acoustic chair , a structural chair at the structural and a structural chair at the same time .
Professor Carter , my collaborator , we went back to nature to be inspired by , and by designing this pattern from irregular surface pattern , it becomes <unk> .
You know this surface of 44 different properties , that vary by stiffness , <unk> vary and color , <unk> to the dots of pressure in the human body .
Its surface , as in nature , stick its functionality through the addition to the other material or the other assembly , but it 's continually going to continuously be the material .
But is the ideal nature ?
Is n't there in nature ?
I did n't grew up in a Jewish home , but when I was a young boy , my grandmother told me about the Hebrew Bible stories , and one of them got me left and define a lot of what matters to me in the Hebrew Bible . ''
As she says , `` In the third day of the Creation , God sends the Earth to grow a tree , <unk> <unk> of fruit . ''
For that first tree , there would be no difference between trunk , branches , leaves and fruits .
The whole tree was a fruit .
Instead , the land has got to grow trees with branches , cortex , water and flowers .
The land created a world made out of parts .
I often ask , `` What would be the design if the objects were made out of one piece ? ''
Would you take a better place from creation ? ''
So we 're looking for the biblical material , the kind of material <unk> tree with fruit , and we find it .
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> , and about 100 million tons are produced by organisms like shrimp , crabs , crabs and crabs and butterflies and butterflies .
We think that if we could tune into the properties , we could generate <unk> structures in one piece .
So that 's what we did .
We call it legal <unk> . We call it a pile of shrimp , the <unk> and we 've produced <unk> <unk> .
We banned chemical concentrations , we 've been able to achieve a wide range of properties , from the very , very tough hard light , to the light , soft and transparent .
To print the large-scale structures , it was built into a system with multiple noise of <unk> controlled .
The robot could change the material properties material 's properties and create these structures made out of one three 3.5 -- a couple of recyclable , 100 percent recyclable .
When the pieces are ready , it turns out dry to find a natural way to find a natural form of contact with the air .
So why do we keep designing with plastic ?
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain themselves , they used them for the first time on the planet , 3.5 billion years ago , as we heard yesterday .
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT collaborators , <unk> the bacteria that genetically engineered bacteria to capture carbon out of the atmosphere .
For the first time , we 've been able to generate structures that they do their transition from no problems with mesh beams , and if it broadens even more , windows .
A tree charged with fruit <unk> .
Working with an old material , one of the first forms of life on the planet , with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology , we 've transformed a <unk> structure from shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree .
And here 's the best part : for objects designed to biodegrade , put them in the sea , <unk> wildlife , and put them on the ground , will help grow a tree .
The adjustment for our next exploration using the design principles was the solar system .
We 're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain life trips .
To do that , we need to master bacteria and control their flow .
So , like the periodic table , we made our own elements of elements of life , new forms of life created it , made it biological form .
I like to think of synthetic biology , like the liquid , just rather than rather than precious metals are hidden in new biological functionalities within new biological functionalities systems .
This field is called microfluidics .
Let 's turn our own 3D channels to control the flow of these bacterial bacterial crops .
In our first piece of clothing , they combined two microorganisms .
The first is <unk> .
It lives in our oceans and the fresh water ponds .
And the second E. coli , the bacteria that lived in the human intestine .
A light turns off , the other sugar , the other sugar and produces <unk> and useful biofuels for the built environment .
But these two microorganisms , they do n't interact in nature .
In fact , they never met .
They 're here , designed for the first time to have a relationship in a piece of clothes .
Think of it as evolution , not by natural selection , but design evolution .
To contain these relationships , we 've created a single channel that is like the digestive tract resembles the digestive tract , to help the function of these bacteria , which we 've created the path function .
And so we started to grow up to grow those channels in the human body , including the properties of material as well as we wanted them .
If we wanted more photosynthesis , we would give them more transparent channels .
This wearable digestive system , when you reach from one end to another , 60 meters for 60 meters .
This is half the length of a football field , and 10 times more than our thin intestine .
And here is , we 're born at TED , our first wearable channels with bright liquids , brilliant liquids with life inside .
Thank you .
Mary Shelley said , `` We 're all creatures in fashion , only half is made . ''
What if the design would provide the other half ?
What if we could create structures that make stuff up alive ?
What if we could create personal <unk> that our skin is broken into the damaged tissue and get our bodies damaged into ?
Think of this as a way of editing biology .
I call this the material ecology .
For that , you always have to go back to nature .
So now , you know that a 3D printer applied material in layers .
You also know that nature does n't .
It grows . <unk> with sophistication .
This cocoon of worm , for example , it creates a highly sophisticated architecture , a home inside of which you 're going off .
Sustainable manufacturing is not about this level of sophistication .
It 's doing it by the <unk> combination , but of two proteins at different concentrations .
One acts as a structure , the other is the glue or the matrix , or the matrix , together .
And this happens through scales .
The silk worm first turn in the environment , creates a structure of tension , and then it starts to get down a cocoon of compression .
<unk> and compression the two forces of life , they manifest themselves in a single material .
In order to better understand how this complex process works , we attach to a small magnet 's head of a little bit of silk worm to get a line of silk worm .
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors , and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm .
However , when you put the silk worm on a flat patch , not inside a box , we realized that it was a cocoon of a flat , and we realized it 's a cocoon , it 's <unk> <unk> .
So we started to design different environments , different scaffolding , and we 've discovered that shape , the composition , the structure of cocoon , directly passed through the environment .
Often , the silk worms , to death inside their cocoons to death inside their cocoons , their silk get paid and used in the textile industry .
We saw that designing these templates in designing these templates , we can make raw silk raw silk .
It <unk> <unk> , and we could create these things .
So we actually climb this process up to the architectural scale .
We had a robot <unk> by making silk templates , and we put it into our site .
We knew that silk worms will come up to the most dark , cold areas , so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure .
So we created holes or <unk> , to block the rays of the light and heat the silk worms over the structure of silk .
We were ready to get the caterpillars ones .
We asked them worms 4,000 hundred thousand silk silk farm farm .
And after you feed them four weeks of them , they were ready to get off with us .
We put them carefully at the bottom of the scaffolding , and as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , put eggs , and life begins again , like us , but much , much , short .
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity , and it was right .
In biological silk , biological silk silk silk , and they give it all this pavilion .
And in a little bit more than three weeks about two or three weeks , they fill in <unk> silk worms these thousand miles of silk worms .
In a curious symmetry is the length length of the silk route .
The moths , after the <unk> , produce 1.5 million eggs .
This could be used for 250 additional pavilions in the future .
So here 's the two visions of the world .
A silk <unk> by a robotic arm , the other space .
If the last frontier of design , it is to give life products and buildings around us , to form the building ecology , designers have to bring these two visions of the world .
Which brings us back , of course , at the beginning .
Here is a new era of design , a new era of creation , which brings us from design inspired by nature to an inspired nature in the design , which requires us , for the first time in charge of us in nature .
Thank you .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Raise your hand if you 've ever asked you , if you 've ever asked your hand , `` What do you want to be older ? ''
If you had to remember how old people were when you first asked this first time this ?
You can put your fingers on your fingers .
Three . Five . Three . Three . Five .
Now raise your hand if you ask `` What do you want to be older ? ''
It 's caused some kind of anxiety .
Any anxiety .
I 'm somebody who could never answer to the question `` What do you want to be older ? ''
The problem was not that I had no interest , but I had too many .
In school , I like English , <unk> and art and art and websites , and also playing the guitar in a punk band , called <unk> <unk> .
You may have heard about us .
And generally I like to try and persist anyway , having dedicated to having spent a lot and energy and sometimes in this field .
But over time , this sense of boredom , this feeling of , is no longer challenging , it comes to <unk> .
And I have to leave it .
But then I 'm going to tell you about something else , something completely different , and I 'm going to get myself on it , and I 'm going , and I 'm going , `` Yeah ! I 'm finding out my way , '' and then I 'm going , `` Yeah ! I 've found myself , '' and then I 'm going , and then
And finally , I want to leave it .
But then I 'd like to discover something new and different , and I 'd like to go into it .
This pattern caused me a lot about anxiety , for two reasons .
The first one was , because I was n't sure how I was going to turn all this into a race .
I thought I should choose one thing , to deny all my other passions , <unk> of <unk> .
Another reason why caused me so much was a little bit more personal .
I worried that would have a bad thing wrong with this , and a bad thing on me was doing nothing .
I was worried about being a fear of engagement , or being dispersed , or being dispersed or to my own success .
If you can relate my story , and these feelings , I 'd ask you something that I 'd like to ask you , then .
Ask yourself themselves , where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to make things .
I 'll tell you where they learned , they learned about culture .
And we ask ourselves , `` What do you want to be older ? ''
When we have about five years .
And the truth is that nobody cares about what you 're going to do at that age .
It 's considered a naive question to create cute answers in kids like , `` Being an astronaut , '' or `` I want to be a pirate . ''
He 's going to be the costume suit here .
So this question comes over and again as you grow up in a time , and you 're growing up in a high school , you ask them you 're going to choose to go on the university .
And at some point , `` What do you want to be older ? ''
It 's going to be a nice exercise from before we remove the dream .
Why ?
If this question inspire kids to dream with what they might be , it 's not inspired to dream with anything that they might be .
In fact , it does just the opposite , because when someone asks you a question about what you want to be , you ca n't answer with 20 different things , you can be able to answer with 20 different things , but you might say `` Oh , `` Oh , what 's nice , but you ca n't be artisan and a psychologist . ''
You have to choose . ''
This is Dr. Bob Childs and he is artisan artisan and <unk> .
And this Ng Ng , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a creative head .
But most of the kids do n't hear about people like this .
Everything you hear is that they 're going to have to choose .
But that 's more than that .
The notion of <unk> is very idealized in our culture .
It 's this idea of destiny or real vocation , the idea that each of us has something that I spend over their time on this land , and you have to figure out what that thing is , and I spend your life out of it .
But what if you 're someone who is not connected in this way ?
What happens if there are lots of different issues that will wake up your curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do ?
There is no place for somebody like that in that framework .
And so you can feel just like that .
You can feel that it does n't have a goal .
And feeling that there 's something wrong with one .
There 's nothing wrong with you .
You are a <unk> .
An <unk> is somebody with many different interests and creative activities .
It 's a breath like that .
It could help if you divide up in three parts : multiple , a potential and <unk> .
You can also use other terms of how many of the same idea of the same idea , like scholar , <unk> .
During the time of the Renaissance , the ideal was who I was with in multiple disciplines .
Barbara <unk> refers to us as `` scanners . ''
You would take any term you like , or you 'd like yourself .
It seems like a kind of a <unk> to a community , we can not agree with an identity alone .
It 's easy to look at the <unk> as limitation or woe you have to beat up .
But what I 've learned by talking about people and writing about these ideas on my website , is that there are huge strengths in being this way .
Here are three superpowers .
One : the synthesis of ideas .
I mean , the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new at the intersection .
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> expressed their shared interests in cartography , data , travel , travel , math and design , when they were <unk> .
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> inspiring jewelry .
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea of their own eclectic goals of skills and experiences .
Innovation happens at intersections .
That 's where new ideas come from .
And <unk> , with all of their background , can access a lot of these points of at intersection .
The second superpower second <unk> is learning fast learning .
When we were <unk> , we 're going to do it .
We look at everything we can have in our hands .
We 're used to being beginners , because it was many times in the past , and this means we 're less afraid of testing to test things out new and go out of our comfort zones from our comfort .
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines , and we bring everything that we learned to every new zone that we rarely start out on , so we rarely start out from zero .
<unk> <unk> is a complete <unk> <unk> and writer independent time .
As a child young pianist had had an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory .
Now , she 's the fastest saying .
Before he became a writer , <unk> was a financial planner .
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics , when they were starting to learn the most fine ability to write for publishers .
It rarely is a waste of time for you to get to yourself , even if you finally get it out .
It 's possible to apply that knowledge in a different field , in a way that you could not have anticipated .
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability . That 's the capacity to transform anything you need in a given situation .
Abe <unk> is sometimes director of videos , other , designer , pages of Kickstarter , sometimes a Kickstarter consultant -- sometimes a Kickstarter , , James Bond .
It 's valuable because it makes a good job .
He 's even more valuable because they can take different roles , depending on the needs of different customers .
<unk> magazine defined adaptability as the most important capacity for development , to thrive in the 21st century .
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that they can be able to meet the needs of the market needs to be able to get the market needs .
<unk> of ideas , quickly learning and adaptability : three abilities where they are very adept , and they 're three abilities that they might lose if they 're a stressed to reduce their goals .
As a society , we have a great interest in encouraging people to encourage them .
We have complex problems , multidimensional right now , and we need creative creative thinkers to address them .
Let 's say it 's in your heart , specialists .
They came out of the belly knowing because they wanted to be young women .
Do n't worry , there 's nothing bad about it either .
In fact , some of the best teams in a specialist and a <unk> <unk> .
The specialist 's specialist in depth and put ideas , and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge breadth and a piece of ideas offers a breadth of knowledge .
It 's a beautiful relationship .
But we should all have to design lives and careers that we should be connected to how we 're connected .
And unfortunately , <unk> are largely encouraging them to just be more encouraging partners .
I once said that , if there 's one thing that you take off from this talk , I hope that it 's going to be , <unk> with internal wiring , whatever .
If you 're a heart specialist , then you 're <unk> through all the media .
That 's where you will give you the best thing .
But to the <unk> in the room , including the people who just just realized to be one of them in the last 12 minutes , I 'm telling you , you know , <unk> with their many passions .
Keep your curiosity through your rabbit .
They take intersections .
It <unk> our internal wiring led to a more authentic life and happy .
And perhaps most important , <unk> , the world needs us !
Thank you .
In 1901 year , a woman called <unk> was taken to a psychiatric habitat .
<unk> <unk> , and I could n't remember even the most basic details of his life .
His doctor was called <unk> .
He did n't know how to help <unk> , but she did n't know her , unfortunately , unfortunately , in 1906 .
After his death , <unk> did a look at autopsy , they found weird and he found out in the <unk> brain , and he 's a guy who had never seen before .
The most amazing thing .
If I would have been alive today , we could n't give her to her more help than he had been able to put her forward 114 years ago .
<unk> was Dr. <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> , the first patient to get a diagnosis we now call Alzheimer 's disease .
Now , since 1901 , medicine has advanced advanced .
They 've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the infections , so many treatments for cancer , many treatments have been discovered for HIV .
But recently , it has a disease treatment .
I 'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer 's disease for more than a decade .
So , I think about this all the time .
Alzheimer 's now affects 40 million worldwide .
But by 2050 , it will affect 150 million , by the way , to include a lot of you .
If you 're waiting to live up up to age 85 or more , the possibility for Alzheimer 's , to be almost one of two .
In other words , there 's the likelihood that you spend your <unk> <unk> with Alzheimer 's or helping to take care of a friend or being wanted with Alzheimer 's .
In America alone , caring disease costs $ 200 billion dollars every year .
One of five dollars of healthcare is spending disease disease .
Today , it 's the most expensive disease , and its costs a rise to five times by 2050 , as we get older generation of the cost of the boom .
It may surprise you , but Alzheimer 's is one of the biggest medical challenges and social challenges .
But it 's done relatively little to fight fight .
Today , one of the first 10 causes of death from all over the world , Alzheimer 's the only one that you ca n't prevent , to cure or even development .
We understand less than Alzheimer 's disease than other diseases , because we have spent less time and money on the research of the same .
The U.S. government spends 10 times every year in cancer research that 's in Alzheimer 's disease , despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer 's disease , and cause cancer .
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause : the lack of consciousness .
Because this is what few people know , but everybody should have , Alzheimer 's disease is a disease , and we can cure it .
For most of the last 40-some years , we all , even scientists , <unk> Alzheimer 's disease .
We think we 're going to be able to get them into a normal and inevitable part of aging .
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain healthy brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer 's disease to see the real physical damage damage to this disease .
It 's also a severe <unk> of memory loss and mental skills , the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer 's disease , significantly .
Remember , Dr. Alzheimer 's found plates , strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago .
For almost a century , we did n't know a lot about it .
Today we know that they 're made from protein molecules .
You can think of a molecule as a piece of paper that folds up like an origami .
There are places on the paper that are sticky .
And when it turns out well , these sticky spots right inside .
But sometimes things go wrong , and some sticky points are left on outside .
This makes protein molecules stick with each other , forming groups that can form big plates and fix .
That 's what we see in the brain patients with Alzheimer 's .
We 've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University in Cambridge trying to understand how this dysfunction works .
There are lots of steps , and the identification of what step block is a complex , kind of complex one pump like oxytocin .
<unk> a wire could do nothing .
<unk> others can make the bomb explode .
You have to find the right step out of it , and then create a drug that does it .
Until recently , in its most part of the wires have been reduced and waited best .
But now there 's a diverse group of people now , doctors , biologists , geneticists , physicists , engineers , physicists and mathematicians and mathematicians and so on .
And together , we 've managed to identify a critical step in the process , now , a new kind of drugs that is blocking specifically this way to stop the disease .
Let me show you some of our last results .
No one outside our lab has seen it yet .
Let 's look at some videos of what happened to test these drugs in worms .
These are healthy worms , and you can see it 's moving in normal .
These worms , on the other hand , have protein molecules that stick in each other , like humans with Alzheimer 's .
And you can see it 's clearly sick .
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at a early stage , then we see that heal and live a normal life live .
This is just an initial positive result , but research like this shows that Alzheimer 's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure .
After 114 years of waiting , there 's real hope that you can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years of what you can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years of now . ''
But so that grow that hope , to grow the Alzheimer 's disease , we need help .
It 's not about scientists , it 's about you .
We need to argue that Alzheimer 's disease is a disease , and if we try , it 's <unk> .
In the case of other diseases , patients and their families have the more research and human-powered about governments , pharmaceutical industry , scientific and legislators .
That was essential to move forward in HIV in the late '80s .
Today we see that same same unit to overcome cancer .
But Alzheimer 's often often ca n't speak for themselves .
And their families , hidden victims , caregivers , their loved ones , and night , are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change .
So , it really depends on you .
Alzheimer 's disease is not , in most cases , a genetic disease .
Everybody has a brain run at risk .
Today , there 's 40 million patients like <unk> , which can not create the change they need for themselves .
<unk> talking about them , and help demand a cure . ''
Thank you .
I published this article in the spinal column of The New York Times article , in January of this year .
To love with someone , I do this .
And the article is about a psychological study , designed to create romantic love in the lab , and from my own experience as a last summer , same one night .
So the procedure is quite simple : Two strangers will be infected by 36 questions , and then they 're both looking at the eyes of the more personal and then they 're both looking at the eyes without talking to speak for four minutes .
Here 's a couple of questions of example .
Number 12 : If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or a skill , what would it be like ?
Number 28 : When you did the last time ever ask another person ?
And just ?
So , they 're going to move forward , these are increasingly personal .
Number 30 : -- I mean , you like to -- Tell your spouse , what you like about him or her .
When I came across this study a few years ago , a little detail really called attention , the gossip that was two of the participants had been married six months later , and I was invited to the lab at the ceremony .
So , it was skeptical about this process of making romantic love , but , since then , I was also intrigued with this process of making romantic love .
And when I had a chance to test this study , with someone who I knew particularly well , I did n't expect to fall .
But yet , we fell in love with us , and I thought that was a good story , so I send it to the spinal cord Museum a few months later .
That was published in January , and now it 's August , so I guess some of you will probably be wondering : they 're going to still be wondering : they 're going to do it still ?
And the reason I think that 's why this question is because I 've been asked this question over and over the last seven months .
And this question is just what I want to talk about today .
But let 's go back to the subject .
A week before the article published was very nervous .
I 'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years , so , so , I had to write about my experience on romantic love myself .
But a blog blog can come up with a few hundred views of seen , and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have a few thousands of views .
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship .
But as he gave , he had no idea .
The article was released on a Friday night , and on a Saturday night , this was in my blog traffic .
And Sunday was already called the Today Show and the Good Show .
Within a month , the paper received over eight million hits , and I was saying something , to say something , a little bit prepared for this kind of attention .
One thing is to foster trust with sincerity writing , but something else is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news and people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship .
And when people called it or write , what they did every day for weeks , they would always ask the same question : still , they do the same question , still , they still do the same question together ?
In fact , when I was preparing this talk , I made quick in the mailbox of my email with the phrase , `` still follow together ? ''
And several messages came up immediately .
They were from students and journalists , like this one .
I was interviewed on the radio and they asked him .
Even , I gave a talk , and a woman screamed at the stage , `` Hey , you know where your boyfriend is ? ''
And I immediately threw red .
I understand that 's part of the deal .
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper , you should hope people feel comfortable about it .
But I was n't prepared for the wingspan of the wingspan .
At 36 questions seemed to have their own life .
In fact , the New York Times ran a complementary article for Valentine 's Day , including the study of readers of the readers to prove the study in them with different degrees of success .
So , my first urge to all this attention was to be very addressed with my own relationship .
I said that not every request we both did a public dawn together .
And we were going on television interviews the <unk> requests from the photos of us two .
I think I was afraid of becoming a fear of <unk> , the <unk> process that I did n't feel at all the qualified icons .
And I understand that people did n't want to just know if the study worked , they wanted to just know if the study really worked , whether it really worked , whether it was able to produce love -- whether it was able to produce love love , not just an adventure , but a real love of adventure , it 's <unk> .
But this was a question I did n't feel to answer .
My relationship was just a few months , and I felt , above all , people made the wrong question question .
How do you follow them up or not , and then you would say it ?
If the answer was not , would the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting questions ?
Dr. Arthur Aron wrote first about these questions in 1997 , in 1997 , and the goal of research was not to produce romantic love .
Instead , rather than that , I was looking for interpersonal approach between college students , using what Aron meant called sustained , sustained , progressive , reciprocal , reciprocal and reciprocal , progressive , reciprocal , reciprocal , reciprocal , progressive , reciprocal , reciprocal fact .
It sounds romantic , right ?
But the study itself worked .
The participants they were more close to do that . Several later that they also used to use also the <unk> <unk> protocol from Aron as a rapid form of creating confidence and interaction between strangers .
They 've been able to have used it for members of the police and the community , and they 've used it , and they 've used it to have the opposite policies .
The original version of the story , which I tried the summer last summer , which we combine personal questions with four visual contact with four visual contact with four visual contact with four visual contact .
A few months ago , I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts university , and then a student came up to me and said to me with shyness did the study and it did n't work on me .
And he seemed puzzled .
And I mean , you want to tell you from the person you did ?
Well , he paused .
I think she just wants us to be friends .
And me , did they get better friends ?
Did you feel more feel better after I test the study ?
She nodded .
So , it worked . '' I said .
However , I do n't think that was the answer that he was looking for .
In fact , I do n't think it 's the answer that none of you are looking for love .
I came across the first time when I was a study , and I was going through a really hard really hard separation .
He had had that relationship since , since I had 20 , which was really not my adult life , and he was my first real love idea , and he had no idea about how or she could live without him .
So I pushed myself into science .
And I did all of the things that I could find on romantic love science , and hoped that that could sort of make the heart fit .
I do n't know if I realized that at the moment I just did research , I thought I just did research , but in retrospect , it seems really obvious .
I thought , if I built up with the knowledge of romantic love , I would never have to feel so bad and I used to feel as bad and I used to feel like I was so then .
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or a different way .
I 'm more patient with love . I 'm more relaxed .
I have more confident to demand what I 'm looking for .
But I can also see myself more clearly , and I can realize that what I 'm looking for is sometimes more than I can demand .
What I 'm looking for love is a guarantee , not just being loved today and being loved tomorrow , I 'm not just loved today , by the person I love you .
It may be the guarantee that 's the guarantee that people would ask when they were still together .
The story that was told about 36 questions about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to love in love .
There may be a way to mitigate something at risk implicit at risk implicit , and this is a very attractive story , because in love with us , it makes us feel beautifully .
But I think when it comes to love , we 're very willing to accept the short version of history .
The story of the story asking : still follow together ?
And its content with a <unk> response or not .
So more than a question , would we ask that ask more questions , questions , questions , questions , questions like , how do you decide who you deserve love and who deserve your love .
How do you stay in in in in with a while , when things get tough ? ''
How do you live with uncertainty , which inevitably leads to a relationship , or more , how do you live with your partner doubt ?
I do n't know the answers to these questions , but I think they 're a good beginning to have a more reflective talk about what 's about to love someone .
So , if you want the short version of the history of my relationship , it 's this one ; it 's a year , a known and I applied a study of romantic love to create romantic love , we fell in love , we still fall in love , we still love together , and I 'm very happy .
But in love in love , it 's not the same thing that remain in love .
<unk> is the easy part .
So at the end of my article in my article : `` Love does n't happen . ''
<unk> fall in love because we took the choice to be .
And I shudder to read it now , not because it 's true because it 's true , but because at the time , it was n't true .
It did n't consider how many times we have both to make that decision , and how much times I 'm going to do that choice , and I 'm going to have to do that choice and do that choice without knowing if he 's always going .
I want it enough to have done , and I responded 36 questions , and I said 36 questions to love someone so generous , kind and fun and fun and expressed that choice on the U.S. 's largest newspaper .
But what I 've done , instead , is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I do n't really believe .
And what I 'm looking for , and what I might spend my life looking for is really true .
I want the happy end to implicit in the title of my article , which is , by purpose , the only part of the article that I did n't actually write .
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone , and the hope that he 's also love is , and it 's terrifying that he also love , and that 's terrifying , but that 's the deal with love .
Thank you .
I was raised by a bunch of mountain lesbian , and I sort of got it like a <unk> forest .
And in New York City , a time ago , something really affected me , but more details later .
I 'll start with when I was eight years old .
I took a box of wood , and you put it a dollar ticket , a pen and a fork , a fork and a fork and a fork , and a fork in Colorado in Colorado .
And I thought that some of these strangers or strangers would find this box about 500 years later , and let 's look at how our sort of <unk> ideas , for example how we eat spaghetti .
I had no idea .
But anyway , it 's funny because here I am , 30 years later , and I 'm still doing boxes .
At one point , I was in Hawaii , I like to walk out of excursion and surfing , and all of those rare things -- and I was doing a collage for my mother .
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to Agnes Martin , Agnes , in resin , and have a bee stuck .
Well , my mother is afraid of the bees and it 's <unk> to them , so I put more resin on the canvas , thinking I could get it out .
Instead , it happened : somehow , somehow it seemed like it 's <unk> , as if it was that text .
So I did ? I built more boxes .
This time , I started adding electronics , frogs , strange frogs , strange frogs finding out the street , because I was looking for things , because I was looking for things that I was looking for things , because I was looking for things all my life , trying to relate it to stories about my life .
So I started drawing around the objects , and realizing that my God can draw in space .
I can flow <unk> , just just like it 's done around a body in the crime scene .
And I took out the objects , and I created my own specimens of individuals invented .
First , the botanical -- you know , you 'll be able to make an idea .
I then did some insects and strange creatures .
It was so fun to draw in the resin layers .
And it was great , because I started building exhibitions and things , and I was making some of them , and I was making some money , to bring my girlfriend to dinner for example , to get my girlfriend out of dinner shows .
It was great , man .
At some point , I was interested in the human form , kind of sculptures , resin sculptures , kind of drawings of human beings inside the layers .
It was great , except for one thing : I was dying .
I did n't know what to do , because the resin was going to kill me .
And I went to bed every night thinking about it .
So I tried to use glass .
I started drawing on the glass layers , similar to drawing the drawing in a window , then in another window and the other window , and he had all these windows together that they put together that they draw three-dimensional composition .
And this really worked , and so I could stop using the resin .
So I did this for years , and my work with something very big , which I call myself `` triptych . ''
For the triptych , I was inspired by `` The garden of the delight , '' from Hieronymus Bosch from Hieronymus Bosch in Spain .
Do you know it ?
Well , it 's a fantastic picture .
They say it 's a little ahead of your time .
Well , `` triptych . '' <unk> this piece .
It 's 11 pounds pounds .
It 's five feet long .
It has double face , so that 's 10 feet of composition .
It 's a little weird .
Well , that 's the source of blood .
On the left , is Jesus and the lobsters .
There 's a cave where all these creatures with animals with animal head travel between two worlds .
They 're going from the world of representation of an analog mesh to hidden where they hide .
Here 's where creatures with animal heads go to the <unk> , ready to commit suicide lists in the ocean .
The ocean is made out of thousands of elements .
This is a bird God tied up to a <unk> .
Billy Graham is on the sea ; the Kitra -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> ; the shelter by Osama Bin Laden bin Laden , there are all kinds of bizarre things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean .
Anyway , also , a kind of <unk> .
It 's coming out of the ocean , and it spits out oil in a hand , while the other hand is clouds .
Their hands are like <unk> , and it seems like a mythological way that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium .
So that 's a look like `` triptych . ''
It 's a little bit of narrative .
That 's the hand that it spits out .
And then , when you go to the other side , you have a nose like a bird , you spit out the <unk> of this nose .
It also has a <unk> tail tail , a snake tail , which joins the `` triptych . ''
Anyway , their tail turns fire into a <unk> volcano .
I do n't know why that .
Things that they spend , you know .
Her tail ends up in a <unk> balloon <unk> made from terrorists in 1986 .
Have you ever seen them ?
They were done in the 1980s , as if they were baseball cards of terrorists .
It 's very <unk> . This brings me to my last project .
I 'm in the middle of two projects : One is called `` <unk> . ''
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings .
Each one is a file of our culture , through media and material , whether it 's encyclopedias and magazine , or or magazines .
But each one acts as a kind of file file in a form of human being , and travel in groups of 20 , four or 12 .
They 're like cells , they get together , they divide .
And you can walk between them . I 'm carrying .
Each one is basically a microscope strip that it weighs a human , it 's a trapped inside it .
This has a little cave on his chest .
That 's the head ; it 's your chest , <unk> , <unk> .
I 'm going to touch them for the rest of the body : there 's a waterfall coming out of the chest , and you cover the penis or <unk> , or whatever it is .
It 's a quick quick scan of these works , because I ca n't afford it for a long time .
We have layers , you can see it .
This is a <unk> body .
This has two heads , and it 's communicating between two .
There are some pills coming out and come in the head of this weird statue .
There 's a little forest scene inside the ribcage .
Can you see it ?
Anyway , this talk is about these boxes , just like the boxes we live in .
We 're in a box , the solar system is a box .
This brings me to my last box .
It 's a brick box . It 's called Pioneer Pioneer .
And within this box there is a physicist , a neuroscientist , a painter , a musician , a musician , a <unk> , a <unk> , a museum radio , a museum , a book , a publisher , a publishing arm that spreads all the content .
You get the box and all the people inside some of the other kinds of particles like particles .
And I think that 's the way to change the world .
When you redefines who is and the box that you 're living in .
And together we realize that we 're all together , that this illusion , that this illusion that we are different , these concepts of countries , the countries , the borders , the religion , it does n't work .
We 're all very made all of the same stuff and in the same box .
And if we do n't start to exchange those things with sweetness and continents , we 're going to die pretty soon .
Thank you very much .
What do you do when you hurt your head away ?
They take an aspirin .
But in order for this pill , against pain , first goes through the stomach , our bowels and other organs .
I 'll take a pill that is the most effective system and <unk> , so that any drug would have an effect on the body .
The disadvantage , however , is that by <unk> any drug gets diluted out .
And this is a big problem , especially with HIV patients .
When they take antiretroviral drugs , they 're going to be able to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood , and will increase the count stem cell count .
But they are also known for their adverse side effects , mostly negative , because in the time , because in the time that just take it into your blood stream in your blood stream , it will be worse , and worse , in the HIV warehouse .
These are regions of body like lymph nodes , the nervous system , lungs where the virus is dead , and not easily in the bloodstream of the patients who are <unk> to the regular drugs .
However , after the treatment , the virus can rise and infect new blood cells .
This is the big deal of HIV treatment with the current drug treatment that is the current treatment of life managed to managed by oral lives .
One day , I sat down and thought , `` Could we get the treatment directly directly into the virus , without the risk of exploitation of drugs ? ''
As a scientific expert in lasers , the answer was in front of me : lasers , of course .
If they are used in dentistry , for caring for wounds and diabetes surgery can be used for anything imaginable , including the <unk> transportation of drugs .
In fact , we 're using a laser pulses to open up or drill holes , and drill holes extremely small , which open up and close to immediately the cells infected HIV with HIV to introduce drugs .
You know , `` How is that possible ? ''
We sent a little bit laser beam laser beam over the cellular cellular infected with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid living in a liquid that contains the embedded building that drug contains the drug contains the drug .
The laser goes through the cell , while the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of microseconds .
Before you even notice , the hole is immediately dumped immediately .
We 're now testing this in vitro technology in vitro technology , but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body , apply it to the human body .
`` How is that possible ? '' you can ask yourself .
Well , the answer through three heads .
With the first head , which is our laser , we 'll make an incision into the infection site .
The second head one camera , goes to the site of infection .
Finally , the third head , a <unk> that is distributed to the drug , it releases it directly into the infection , whereas the laser is used to keep the cells open .
Well , this does n't look a lot .
But one day , if it 's successful , this technology can lead to total HIV eradication of body .
Yeah . A cure for HIV .
This is the dream of all HIV researcher in our case , a laser treatment .
Thank you .
In the last decade , I 've been studying armed groups , not state organizations : armed organizations like terrorists , insurgents or militia .
<unk> what these groups do when they 're not shooting .
My goal is to understand better to these generators of violence generators , and study ways of violent participation agents of violent participation .
I do work in field , in the world of politics and the library .
Understanding , to these groups is key to solving a whole conflict , because the war has changed .
It used to be a dispute between states .
No .
It 's now a conflict between states and non-governmental actors .
For example , of the <unk> peace deals between 1975 and 2011 , they signed up in a state and a non-governmental actor between a state and 2011 actor .
That 's why we need to understand these groups , we even have to engage or be <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution .
But how do you do that ?
We need to know what drives these organizations .
We know very well the reasons why they struggle , how they do it , but no one analyzes what they do when they do n't fight .
The armed struggle and policies were not armed by armed policies .
It 's all part of the same organization .
We ca n't understand these groups , not much less <unk> , global vision .
<unk> groups of today are complex organizations .
For example , the Lebanese boy , met by his violent tragedy against Israel .
Since its creation in the 1970s , <unk> has also established a political party , a network of social services , and military device .
Similarly , the Palestinian Hamas known for his suicide attacks against Israel , also runs the Gaza Bank since 2007 .
So these groups make more than simply shooting .
They 're multitasking .
It 's a complex machine machinery of communication : radio stations , TV stations , Internet websites and strategies .
And here they have the published magazine , printed in English and published to recruit .
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex <unk> of no looting , for example , building companies .
These activities are key .
They allow these groups to increase their strength , to increase their funds , to recruit better and build their brand .
armed groups also do something else : create stronger ties with their population investing in social services .
They build the schools , they run hospitals , they 're putting a professional <unk> programs of professional training programs .
<unk> offers all these services and more .
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population something that the state does n't count : security and protection .
The rise of a Taliban in Afghanistan was torn by the war , or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS , may also be understood the efforts of these groups to provide security .
Unfortunately , in these cases , the security has a significant slum for the population .
But in general , provide social services , means filling a vacuum , a gap <unk> by government , allowing these groups to strengthen and increase their power .
For example , the electoral victory from the Palestinian Hamas ca n't be understood without recognizing the social work of the group .
It 's a really complex scenario , even in the West , when we look at armed groups , we just think of armed groups , we just think about the violent side .
But that 's not enough to understand the strengths in these groups , strategy or long-term vision .
These groups are hybrid .
They 're missing because they fill in the government gaps , and they come up like armed groups and political groups and political groups are involved in violent struggle and provide governance .
And the more complex and more complex , and more complex , these organizations , we can do it as opposed to a state .
How do you call a group like <unk> ?
They put up on a piece of territory , running out all its functions , collect the trash , run the sewer system .
Is it a state ? Is it a rebel ?
Or maybe it 's something else , something new and different .
And what is ISIS ?
The lines are <unk> .
We live in a world in a state of states , without state and hybrids , and the weaker , the states are states , as in the Middle East , in the Middle East , and they fill that space actors .
This is important for governments , because to counter to these groups , they will have to invest more than not military tools .
It takes that vacuum in the center of any sustainable approach to the center of any sustainable approach .
This is very important to set up and strengthen peace .
If we understand better to armed groups , we 'll understand better what incentives to offer providing the violence to nonviolence .
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors , military power , military power battles , but give us peace and peace .
In order to achieve these goals , we need the long-term investments to fill that safety of safety , to fill that government vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle .
Thank you .
I 'm a failure as a woman , as a feminist , as a feminist .
My gender equality views of gender is <unk> , but I 'm afraid to accept openly the feminist label is a <unk> unfair for feminist .
I 'm a feminist , but it 's pretty bad .
And therefore , I was pleased with it as a bad feminist .
Or , at least , I wrote an article called `` The Good feminist , '' and then , in the interviews , people started calling me <unk> <unk> .
So what started as a personal joke meant meant to myself and a deliberate dodo , it 's become something bigger .
Let me take a step back .
When I was a young man , especially in my youth and the 20 years , had strange ideas about feminists -- these women , <unk> , terrified women , crying with men and hated sex , as if that was a bad thing wrong .
Today , I see how women are treated all over the world and anger , in particular , looks like a perfectly reasonable answer answer .
But at the time , I was worried about the tone that I was using the people who would be a feminist .
Being labeled as a feminist was an accusation , a word , taboo , and unpleasant .
I 'm amazed as a woman who does n't follow the rules , which he asks , with high self-esteem and dare to believe it 's equal or higher .
Nobody wants to be that a rebel woman , until he realizes that actually that woman , and ca n't imagine being another person .
Over time , as I was growing up , I started to accept that I am , actually , a feminist , and also , proud to be proud of it .
For me , certain statements are <unk> : women are equal for men .
They put the same paycheck for the same work .
We have a right to travel through the world like <unk> , free to bullying and violence .
We have a right to use such an easy way and accessible control the contraceptives and reproductive services .
We have the right to decide about our bodies without any legislative checks or doctrines .
We have the right to respect .
There 's more .
When you 're talking about the needs of women 's needs , you need to account for our other identities .
We 're not just women .
We 're people with a different body , gender , religion and sexuality , social , social , skills , and more .
We need to have these differences , these differences and how they affect us , the same way it matters to us .
Without this kind of inclusion kind of inclusion kind of inclusion kind of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of inclusion type of
For me , these truths are evident , but to be clear : I 'm a disaster .
I 'm full of contradictions .
There 's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist bit .
I have another confession .
When I drive to work , I listen to rap music .
Although the letter degrades , the women and me deeply overwhelmed , the classic `` Salt <unk> '' of the yin is amazing <unk> .
`` Do you actually get your wet t-shirt .
<unk> , let me give you the shell away ! ''
Think about it .
<unk> poetry , right ?
I 'm completely mortified by my musical taste .
I firmly believe in the work of man 's work , which is all I do n't want to do , including -- all the household tasks , but also killing insects , all household tasks , but also killing insects , collection of garbage and junk maintenance .
I do n't have anything to do with that .
The rose is my favorite color .
I love love magazines and beautiful things .
I can see `` The The <unk> '' and our romantic roles and romantic have me , and I 've got absurd into the <unk> . ''
Some of my crimes are more <unk> .
If a woman wants to adopt her husband in his husband 's husband , I 'm not who who is <unk> .
If a woman decides to stay home to raise your children , I accept that choice , too .
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice , the problem is that our society is <unk> so that makes women be economically vulnerable when they choose .
We fix this problem .
And then , we were pushing the conventional feminism , which has historically , the needs of the needs of color , the workers , the workers , gay and <unk> , for white , for women , in heterosexual and <unk> .
Listen , if that 's good feminism , I 'm a very bad feminist thing .
Also the following : as a feminist , I feel a lot of pressure .
We have this tendency of putting geometrically songs on a pedestal .
We expect it to be perfection .
When we got ourselves , we take a lot of taste from the same pedestal , we put them together .
As I said , I 'm a disaster -- I already consider myself of that pedestal before you try to wear putting up there .
Too many women , particularly the innovative , particularly the innovative ones and the leaders of the sector , they 're afraid of being tagged as feminist .
They 're afraid to stand up and say , `` Yes , I 'm a feminist , I 'm afraid of saying , `` Yes , I 'm a feminist ' fear of what that tag is not to be able to accomplish with some realistic expectations .
Take an example to <unk> , or like I call it , the Goddess .
In the last few years , it 's a <unk> feminist .
In the <unk> Music Airport in 2014 , MTV , in front of the word `` feminist <unk> . ''
It was a wonderful show up on this pop star embrace openly feminism , and the young men that be a feminist , the young men that be a feminist proud .
Taking it , the cultural critics , cultural critics started arguments with endless arguments .
It was their feminism feminism , rather than simply believing the word of an adult woman and grown .
<unk> perfection of feminist , because we 're still fighting a lot , we want a lot to do , we need so much , we need so much , we need a lot so let .
Let 's go a lot beyond serious and constructive and stuffed the feminism of any woman 's feminism , to run up with nothing .
We do n't need to do that .
Very feminism , or rather , one more inclusive is the starting point is the starting point .
But what happens next ?
We went from recognizing our flaws to give the bills , and it will be a little more brave .
If I hear a demeaning music , I 'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing an unlimited supply .
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they 're going to change the change in their songs until they 're going to make their profits affecting their profits .
It certainly is hard .
Why does their music have to be so <unk> ?
It 's hard to pick up something better and so easy to justify to justify a worse choice .
But when the bad decisions are supporting this makes it more difficult for women to make equality , the equality we 're all deserve .
I think about my nieces and my three and four years .
These are two fine little young girls , and it 's just very brave and too brave . I want to grow up in a world .
And that 's where they 're appreciated by strong creatures that are .
I think of them , suddenly , the best option will be seen as something much easier to do .
We can all make better decisions .
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women like sports , <unk> .
We can change radio radio when we hear songs that treat women like nothing .
We can spend our money to go to cinema another part when movies do n't treat women as much as decorative objects are .
We can stop supporting a professional sports where athletes treat their partners as boxing .
In any case , men , especially men , especially men , heterosexual , can say , `` No , I 'm not going to publish any magazine , engage in their project , or work with you , until it does n't include a number of women , so much to be able to participate in that way to make decisions .
I 'm not going to work with you until your publication , or your organization is more inclusive , with a wider range of people . ''
Those of us who are <unk> , but invited us to participate in these kinds of projects , we can also encourage them to be included until more like us are welcome to overcome the barriers .
Because we 're not groupers <unk> . Without these efforts , our accomplishments will actually mean very little .
We can make these small acts of these little courage and expect our decisions come to the top , people in the power directors and music producers , CEOs , CEOs , the people that can make great decisions , more brave , to create a lasting change and significant change change .
We can also claim with courage our feminism , good , bad , either .
The last line of my book is `` Bad <unk> , '' <unk> says , `` I think will be a bad feminist will not be at all . ''
This is true because of many reasons , but I say that , especially , because in the past , my voice was stolen was stolen , and feminism was helped with myself .
There was an incident .
I call it an incident to deal with what happened .
A few guys were telling me when I was very young , and I did n't know that kids can do this to a girl .
They treated me as if it was nothing .
I started to believe it was nothing .
And I was able to tell my voice , and after all I was n't forced to believe that I could say something that could matter .
But ... I was writing .
And with that , I went back to <unk> .
I 'm going to tell me in a stronger version of myself .
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine , and of women who looked like me , and they understood , they understood and understood what it meant to live in the world is the brown skin .
I read the words of women that showed me was nothing .
I learned how to write like them , and then I learned how to write like them .
I found my voice again , and I began to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure .
Through writing up and feminism , I also discovered that if I was a little brave , another woman might hear and look at me and realize that none of us is anything that the world is about to tell us that we are .
In one hand , I have the power to achieve anything .
And in the other , I argue , the humiliating reality that I 'm just a woman .
I 'm a bad feminist , I am a good woman , I 'm trying to improve my thinking , and what I 'm doing , without abandoning everything that makes me human .
I hope we can all do the same thing .
I hope that we can all be a little brave , when you need it more of such courage .
Right after the last year , <unk> children in California had only measles had to visit the Disneyland for having visit any Disneyland for anyone who had been there .
The virus then went through the Canada , with more than 100 children in <unk> .
One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that the measles that can be fatal to a child with a child immune system , which is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world .
There 's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century , but many of the kids involved in the Disneyland outbreak had not been vaccinated , because their parents were afraid of something was supposed to be even worse : autism .
But a moment was n't the article that unleashed autism and vaccines and <unk> vaccines , disqualified and marked for being a deliberate fraud by the British Medical Journal ?
Does n't believe the majority of smart scientists that the vaccine that vaccines cause autism is ?
I think most of you know it , but millions of parents around the world are still trying to find out that vaccines will be in danger to their children of having autism .
Why ?
Here 's why .
This is a graph of the estimates of autism over time .
For the most part of the 20th century , autism was considered a very rare disease .
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about she believed to develop a whole professional life without seeing one case .
For decades , the prevalence of prevalence continued to stable three or four thousand children per 10,000 .
But then , in the 1990s , the numbers started <unk> .
Companies of fundraising funds is referred to routinely as routinely as being referred to as an epidemic by autism as well .
What 's going on ?
If it 's not vaccines , what ?
If you ask the people in the Center for <unk> <unk> , what 's going on , they tend to be based on phrases like `` expanded diagnostics , '' which is going `` <unk> diagnostics , '' and `` <unk> diagnostic criteria , '' to explain these growing figures .
But that kind of language does n't <unk> a lot a young mother 's fears that looks for the face of her two-year-old son , visual contact .
If the diagnosis of diagnosis was they had to go scale , why were they so <unk> at first ?
Why were those cases of such hard autism as you could find out before the 1990s was ?
Five years ago , I decided to figure out the answers to these questions .
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and wary of the science that with the <unk> power of storytelling .
For the most part of the 20th century , doctors told a story about what autism and how autism is , and how it was discovered , but that story turned out , and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health .
There was a second more accurate story that was ever lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature .
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we need to go .
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist , Leo , Johns Hopkins Hospital , in 1943 , Johns Hopkins Hospital , in 1943 , <unk> published an article that describes 11 young young people who seemed private worlds , including <unk> worlds , <unk> people , including their own own parents .
They could have fun for hours by hours waving at their faces , but they were <unk> of panic by <unk> as when they do n't put their favorite toy into their usual room without knowing them .
On the basis of the patients ' basis in their clinic , <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare .
By the decade of 1950 , as a world authority in the subject , I was stated that I 'd seen less than 150 different cases of its syndrome as they would pick up reference reference of places as far as South Africa was picking up references from places as distant as South Africa .
This is actually not surprising , because the criteria of <unk> for autism were actually very <unk> .
For example , I 'm going to give up that diagnosis of children with convulsions , but we now know that epilepsy is very common in autism .
Once he had been told that he had become nine from every 10 children sent to her own doctors to her office , to be autistic without giving you a autism diagnosis .
<unk> was a smart man , but part of his theories were not <unk> .
It will define autism as a form of childhood marriage and <unk> .
These kids , he said , have been carefully held in a refrigerator , which is not <unk> .
At the same time , yet , <unk> noticed that some of their young patients had special skills they were together in certain areas like music and the music and the math and the memory .
One of the children in their clinic could distinguish between 18 symphonies before I turned the two years .
When his mother put one of his favorite records of , he says , `` Beethoven . ''
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills , affirming things like children were just by turning out what they 'd heard about their parents were just taking out their parents who had just heard , desperate to win their approval .
As a result , autism became source of shame for families , and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good , turning into invisible into the world in general .
Remarkably , it was n't until the 1970s , that , researchers started to test the <unk> theory of <unk> that autism was weird .
<unk> <unk> , the cognitive psychologist in London , I thought the theory of <unk> mothers was quite stupid .
She and her husband John , and she was warm , and they had a little bit autistic daughter got out of autistic .
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl like it was to raise a little bit of supportive services , without special education , and not special to all of those resources without a diagnosis .
To defend in the National Health Service , they needed more resources for autistic children and their families , and their families and their colleague Gould Gould , decided to do something that should be done 30 years before .
They launched a study prevalence of autism in the general population .
We had a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community .
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited , because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse .
Some children could n't talk at all , while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics on the dinosaur or a genealogy of the dinosaur or the genealogy of the dinosaurs in the <unk> .
Otherwise , these kids did n't fit very cute and <unk> , as Judith as Judith , and they saw a lot of them , and they saw a lot of them , and they saw a lot of them , and they saw a lot of them , and they saw a bunch of them , much more than the monolithic model , would have predicted .
At first , they were lost to try and make sense of the data .
How did anyone realize these kids had before ?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German 1944 , the year next year to <unk> , and then forgot , buried in the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember .
<unk> knew about this article in the competition , but he avoided <unk> on his own work .
There was not even an English translation , but luckily , the husband of <unk> talking to German talking , and he translated it for her .
The document is offering an alternative human history .
His author was a man named Hans Asperger , who was leading an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna in the 1930s .
The ideas of Asperger 's for teaching children with learning about the teaching of contemporary and learning differences of them were even implanted in contemporary standards .
The morning in their clinic started classes with music exercises , and children kept their games on on Sundays in the afternoon .
Instead of blaming the parents of autism , Asperger 's described as an <unk> disability of life that required support and spaces adapted throughout the course of all life .
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients , Asperger 's called their little teachers , and he started to help in the development of methods of education that they were especially suited to themselves .
Basically , Asperger saw , as a diverse diverse and diverse variety of speech as a whole variety of gifts and disability .
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they 've always been , seeing aspects of this continuum in archetypes as well in pop culture as the awkward social scientist and the <unk> scientist .
He was beyond even to say , that for success in science and art , a little bit of autism is essential .
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in the wrong thing that autism was going to be like , so the parents were <unk> .
Over the next few years , they worked in silence with the American medical Association to expand the criteria of diagnosis by diagnosis .
By the end of the '80s and early in the 1990s , their changes were in place to become place , by by the late '80s , by one broad inclusive model of Asperger 's .
These changes did not fell on a broken leg .
My name , when he <unk> and Judith worked in the way to reform these criteria , people from all over the world would see an autistic adult for reform first time .
Before he came out of `` Rain Man '' in 1988 , just a little circle , <unk> by experts , I knew what autism was , but after the unforgettable performance performance of Hoffman by Hoffman what was about autism , but after the unforgettable performance of `` Rain Man , '' with four of the Academy .
At the same time , the first simple clinical trials are introduced to use to diagnose autism .
I should n't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for their son .
The combination of `` Rain Man , '' the changes in criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect network of network awareness of autism .
The number of diagnostics started to rise up , like , they predicted <unk> and Judith , in fact they hoped that it was , making people with autism and their families finally they had to get the support of autism and the services they are deserved .
Then Andrew <unk> came to blame the rise to the rise of the diagnosis , a simple , powerful , seductive credible story , and seductive credible , and seductive credible , '' as well as the <unk> theory of autism .
If the current estimate of the center of one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum , it 's right , the autistic ones are one of the largest minority of the world .
In the last few years , autistic people have come together on the Internet to reject the idea of the puzzles to solve the new medical advances , we have the term `` <unk> '' to celebrate the varieties of human cognition .
One way to understand the <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems .
The fact that a PC does n't work with Windows , it does n't mean it 's broken .
According to the autistic standards , the normal human brain brain is easily <unk> , social deals , and suffers from a deficit of attention to details .
Now doubt , autistic people have a difficulty of living world built for them .
70 years later , we 're still reaching reaching Asperger , who believed that the `` cure '' for the more aspects of autism are actually found that the teachers , employers who believe that the teachers , employers .
An autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said , `` We need all the hands on covered in <unk> for humanity . ''
While we 're navigating into an uncertain future , we need all forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society .
We ca n't afford to waste a brain .
Thank you .
